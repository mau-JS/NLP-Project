Buzz Mission
"(The film begins in outer space. The title comes up: Toy Story 2. Then green letters appear: GAMMA QUADRANT, SECTOR 4.)"
ZOO-OO-OOM!
"Utility Belt Buzz: Buzz Lightyear Mission log. All signs point to this planet as the location of Zurg's fortress, but there seems to be no sign of intelligent life anywhere."
"(Laser lights appear on Buzz and he looks up to see millions of robots that are armed with lasers surrounding him. Buzz jumps and uses his own laser on the crystal which blows the robots up and sends him flying into the air screaming. Buzz lands on the ground and runs over to a wall to catch his breath when a monitor looks in his direction and beeps. Buzz jumps and zaps it with his laser, destroying it. Then the ground opens up in a Z shape and Buzz jumps in and when it shuts, his suit glows. He runs along the corridor. In a room, a yellow dot appears on a red screen identifying as Buzz. A figure raises his clawed hand and puts it on a lever.)"
"Emperor Zurg: Come to me, my prey."
"(He moves the lever back and the lights in the corridor come on making Buzz stop in surprise. Then a wall with spikes appears behind him and moves towards him. Buzz look back and gasps and runs as the wall closes in on him. Buzz manages to jump through a closing door just in time and the spike ram into the door, denting it. Buzz stands up and saw a battery which reads The Source of Zurg's Power. Buzz walk slowly to the bridge which has discs that floats between him and the battery. Buzz jumps and lands on the discs, each one playing a musical note as he does so. Then, the discs fall suddenly, carrying Buzz with them. Thinking fast, Buzz press a button on his utility belt which makes a force field bubble around him and then he flies upward.)"
"Utility Belt Buzz: To infinity and beyond! (He reaches the platform and deactivates the bubble. He then reaches to grab the battery but his hand went through it, revealing to be an illusion. It then disappears and Evil Emperor Zurg rises up behind Buzz on a platform.)"
"Emperor Zurg: So, we meet again, Buzz Lightyear, for the last time."
"Utility Belt Buzz: Not today, Zurg!"
"(Zurg fires his ion blaster at Buzz but he picks up a disc to shield himself and the blasts bounce off. Buzz throws it at Zurg, hitting him in the face. Buzz somersaults over Zurg but just as he landed and turn around to fire his laser, Buzz spins around so fast and shoots Zurg, and sent him to jail.)"
Utility Belt Buzz: (He surprised with he won.)
"(The letters Game Over appear on the TV screen, revealing that the whole thing was only a video game which is played by Rex, who's wearing a goldfish ball with sicker darts on his head with Buzz, beside him, watching.)"
"Rex: Oh no! No, no, no, no, no!"
Buzz Lightyear: Oooh. You almost had him!
Rex: I'm never gonna defeat Zurg!
"Buzz Lightyear: Sure, you will, Rex. In fact, you're a better Buzz than I am."
Rex: But look at my little arms! I can't press the fire button and jump at the same time!
Woody Lost His Hat
(They then hear a rattling noise and see Woody throwing things out of a drawer as if looking for something.)
(They then hear a rattling noise and see Woody throwing things out of a drawer as if looking for something.)
Sheriff Woody: Where is it? Where is it? Where is it?
Buzz Lightyear: Uh. Woody?
Buzz Lightyear:
Woody: Huh? Oof! (Woody hits his head and falls out of the draw hitting several others on the way down.)
"Buzz Lightyear, and Rex: Ooooh."
"Buzz Lightyear: Hang on, Cowboy! (Buzz Lightyear swings on a red desk lamp, lands on a car and rides it along a looping track and off the jump like in the first movie and spins through the air before landing next to Woody. He runs over and picks him up.) Woody, are you alright?"
"Woody: Oh. Yeah, yeah. I'm fine, Buzz. Okay. Here's your list of things to do while I'm gone. Batteries need to be changed. Toys at the bottom of the chest need to be rotated. Oh, and make sure everyone attends Mr Spell's seminar on what to do if you or part of you is swallowed. Okay? Okay. Good. Okay."
"Buzz Lightyear: Woody? You haven't found your hat yet, have you?"
Woody: No! And Andy's leaving for Cowboy Camp any minute! And I can't find it anywhere!
"Buzz Lightyear: Don't worry, Woody. In just a few hours, you'll be sittin' around a campfire with Andy, makin' delicious, hot schmoes."
"Woody: They're called ""s'mores"", Buzz."
"Buzz Lightyear: (quickly and a bit embarrassed) Right, right, of course. Has anyone found Woody's hat yet?! (The green army men are searching the toy box.)"
"Sarge: Keep looking, men! Dig deeper! (to Buzz.) Negatory. Still searching."
Hamm: (Hamm moves sun blinds up and down as if to signal to someone.) The lawn gnome next door says it's not in the yard. But he'll keep looking.
"Bo Peep: (The door opens and Bo Peep, her sheep and a doll enter the room.) It's not in Molly's room. We've looked everywhere."
Mr Potato Head: (He's coming out from under Andy's bed.) I found it.
Woody: You found my hat?
"Mr Potato Head: Your hat? No. The missus lost her earring. Oh, my little sweet potato!"
"Mrs Potato Head: Oh, you found it! Oh, it's so nice to have a big, strong spud around the house. (Mr Potato Head kisses her side while she giggles.)"
"Woody: Oh, great. That's just great. This'll be the first year I miss cowboy camp, all because of my stupid hat!"
Bo Peep: Woody. Look under your boot.
Woody: Don't be silly. My hat is not under my boot.
Bo Peep: Would you just look?
"Woody: Oh! You see? No hat. Just the word ""Andy."""
Bo Peep: Uh-huh. And the boy who wrote that would take you to camp with or without your hat.
"Woody: I'm sorry, Bo. It's just that... I've been looking forward to this all year. It's my one time with just me and Andy."
Bo Peep: (She's bringing Woody close with her cane.) You're cute when you care.
Woody: Bo! Not in front of Buzz.
"Bo Peep: (She purrs.) Nah, let him look. (As she and Woody are looking at each other, they heard baaing and they turn to see Rex fighting with Bo's sheep over the remote.)"
"Rex: Miss Peep! Your sheep! (Bo whistles to get her sheep's attention. They let go of the remote, making Rex fall over and hit the TV remote's on button and it turns on to play a commercial of Al's Toy Barn with Al the owner dressed up in a chicken suit.)"
"Al McWhiggin: Hey, kids! This is Al from Al's Toy Barn and I'm sittin' on some good deals here. Ow! I think I'm feeling a deal hatching right now! Whoa! Let's see what we got. We got boats for a buck, beanies for a buck..."
"Woody: Rex, turn it off! Someone's gonna hear!"
Rex: (He's getting back up and tapping the remote rapidly trying to find the right button.) Which one is off?!
"Al: Buck, buck, buck! And that's cheap, cheap, cheap! So hurry on down..."
Hamm: For crying out loud! It's this one! (He hits the off button and the TV turns off.) I despise that chicken.
"Slinky: (Then, Slinky enters the room.) Fellas! Fellas! Okay. I got some good news, and I got some bad news."
Mrs Potato Head: What news?
"Slinky: The good news is, I found your hat, Woody."
"Woody: My hat! Oh, Slink. Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Where'd you find it?"
"Slinky: Well, that's the bad news."
[There's some barking coming from down stairs]
Rex: Oh! It's Buster!
Hamm: (gasps)
"Sarge: CANINE ALERT!! MAN YOUR BATTLE STATIONS! LET'S MOVE, MOVE, MOVE! [The soldiers and Rocky run to the door and held it back to hold Buster, a dachshund sausage dog, who is straining against it]"
Bo Peep: Woody! Hide! Quick!
"Woody: Ah! [runs just as Buster bursts into the room and runs around, looking for him. He knocks over Robot and Mr. Spell, the egg toys and the Lincoln Log house where the Potato Heads are kissing frozen. Buster went to Andy's bag and pull Woody out with his mouth and toss him to the floor. Buster growls at Woody at first but then licks him a couple of times, revealing that he's a friendly dog] Okay, okay, okay. Okay! Okay! You found me! Buster! All right. Hey, how did he do, Hamm? [Mr. Spell reads 17.4 seconds.]"
Hamm: Eh... Looks like a new record.
"Woody: OK, boy. Sit. Reach for the sky. [Buster raises his front paws and sit on his butt] Gotcha! [Buster acts being shot and falls over, playing dead] Ohh! Great job, boy. (He rubs Buster's belly as Buster pants happily) Who's gonna miss me while I'm gone? Huh? Who's gonna miss me? Who's gonna miss meeeeee?"
"Andy's Mom: Andy, you got all your stuff?"
"Woody: Okay. Have a good weekend, everybody. I'II see you Sunday night."
"Andy: lt's in my room. [he staggers into the room and Buster run up to him] Stick 'em up. [Buster just scratches his ear and walks away through between Andy's legs] (looking down his legs) l guess we'll work on that later. (to Woody) Hey, Woody. Ready to go to Cowboy Camp?"
"Mrs Davis: Andy, honey. Come on. Five minutes, and we're leavin'."
Andy: Five minutes. Hmm.
Woody Arm Rip
"[Seconds later, he played with his toys]"
"Andy: Help, help! Somebody help me!"
"Andy: Let her go, evil Dr Pork Chop!"
"Andy: Never! You must choose, Sheriff Woody. How shall she die? Shark or death by monkeys? [Andy makes monkey noises whilst holding one close to Bo Peep]"
Andy: Choose!
Andy: I choose Buzz Lightyear! [Andy brings Buzz out of a box riding on RC]
Andy: What?! That's not a choice!
Andy: To infinity and beyond! [He knocks Hamm over and he lands on top of the Army Men]
"Andy: I'll save you, Miss Peep."
Andy: My hero. (kisses Woody)
"Andy: Thanks, Buzz."
"Andy: No problem, buddy. You should never tangle with the unstoppable duo of Woody and Buzz Lightyear. [Then as he stretches the two toys, Woody's arm rips at his shoulder]"
"Andy: (gasps) Oh, no. [His mom comes into the room]"
"Mrs Davis: Andy, let's go! Molly's already in her car seat."
"Andy: But, Mom, Woody's arm ripped."
"Mrs Davis: Oh, no. Maybe we can fix him on the way."
"Andy: No, just leave him."
"Mrs Davis: I'm sorry, honey. But you know toys don't last forever."
"[She put Woody on a shelf and she and Andy left the room. Woody unfreezes and gasps with dismay at that. Buzz, and the other toys look up and see this]"
Rex: What happened?
Mr Potato Head: Woody's been shelved.
Rex: (gasps)
"Woody: [Woody looks at his torn arm, lifts it and then lets it go and it falls down. Woody look out the window to see Andy get into the car] Andy."
[The car drives off. Woody looks sad and let his legs dangle from the shelf. The other toys look up at him]
Slinky: Woody?
"Bo Peep: Woody? Honey, are you okay?"
[Woody pull his legs up out of sight. Bo and Buzz look at each other worriedly]
"[Later, a boy riding a bike throw a newspaper at the house. Woody was asleep when the car pulls up outside the house. He wakes up and saw Andy jumping out and riding on a toy horse]"
"Andy: Yee-haw! Ride 'em, cowboy! Whoo! Yeah, giddy-up! Yeah, giddy-up!"
"Woody: He's back? Hey, everybody! Andy's back! He's back early from cowboy camp! [The toys are playing cards and look up to Woody. Hamm was at the door and heard Andy's footsteps coming closer]"
"Hamm: Places, everybody! Andy's coming! [The toys scattered to their places and Woody freezes as Andy enters the room]"
"Andy: Yeah! (humming The Lone Ranger theme) Hey, Woody! Did you miss me? Giddy-up, giddy-up, giddy-up, giddy-up. Ride 'em, cowboy! [Then he saw the rip in Woody's arm and his smile turns to a frown] Ohh. I forgot. You're broken. I don't want to play with you anymore. [He drops Woody and he falls towards the deck of cards on the floor and as he hit them, he kept falling through the blue area until he went into a black circle and landed in a trash can. Woody looks around to see lots of broken toy hands and parts beside him]"
"Woody: (gasps) No! Andy! No. No, Andy! No! Andy! Andy. Andy. [The toy parts grab Woody by the neck and drag him downward as Andy appears]"
"Andy: Byeee, Woody."
Woody: No! No! No! ANDY!
"[Andy puts the lid on the bin, making it go black. Woody wakes up from a nightmare and saw his rip arm around his neck. He move his arm with strain and hit some books on the shelf and dust spray up, making him cough.]"
Woody Finds Wheezy
[He then heard someone coughing and peep behind the books to see a squeaky toy penguin coughing up some dust]
Woody: Wheezy? Is that you?
"Wheezy: Hey, Woody."
Woody: What are you doing up here? I thought Mom took you to get your squeaker fixed months ago. Andy was so upset.
Wheezy: Nah. She just told him that to calm him down. And then put me on the shelf.
"Woody: Well, why didn't you yell for help?"
"Wheezy: Well? I tried squeakin'. But I'm still broken. No one could hear me. (he wheezes and coughs) Besides, the dust aggravates my condition. [He coughs again and falls back into Woody's hand] What's the point in prolonging the inevitable? We're all just one stitch away. From here. To there. [He points to Andy's mom hammering a Yard Sale sign into the ground outside]"
Woody: Yard Sale. (gasps) Yard Sale. (to the other toys) YARD SALE! Guys. Wake up. Wake up. There's a yard sale outside.
Buzz Lightyear: Yard Sale?
Woody: Sarge. Emergency roll call.
[The toys get into a single line and Buzz and Robot use a check list to see that all the toys are present]
Buzz Lightyear: Hamm?
Hamm: Here.
"Buzz Lightyear: Potato Head, Mr and Mrs?"
Mr and Mrs Potato Head: Here.
Buzz Lightyear: Troikas? Check. Check. Check. Check. Check. Rocky?
Rocky: Here.
Rex: I hate yard sales.
Buzz Lightyear: Slinky?
Rex: [Then he heard footsteps coming towards the room] Aaah! Someone's coming! [The toys runs and Woody hid Wheezy behind the books and froze just as Andy's mom comes in]
Andy's Mom: Okay. Let's see what's up here. [She look under the bed and took out a toy car and put it in a box mark 25 cents on it. She picks up Rex who looks worried and put him aside to get a jigsaw puzzle from which he was standing on and put it in the box. She then grab some hoops and the books which are hiding Wheezy and grab him as well]
"Wheezy: Bye, Woody. [Woody unfreezes and watches in horror as Andy's mom puts Wheezy in the box and left the room]"
"Woody: Wheezy. Oh, come on. Think, think. Woody. Think, think, think. Oh. [He tries to whistle with his right arm but it only makes him blew raspberry so he use his ripped arm to whistle and it works and Buster runs into the room, looking for where Woody is] Hey, here, boy. Here, Buster! Up here! No. No. No. No. No. NO! [He loses his grip on the shelf and fall onto Buster's back] Okay, boy. To the yard sale. Hyah!"
[Buster obeys and runs out of the room with Woody on his back. The toys watch this in awe]
Mr Potato Head: What's goin' on?
Bo Peep: Woody.
Mr Potato Head: He's nuts.
Slinky: His arm ain't that bad.
"Rex: Don't do it, Woody. We love youuu!"
Woody Rescues Wheezy
"Woody: Careful on the steps now. (Buster run down the stairs, making Woody jolt and bump around on his back til he reached the door and stop. They open the door and peep out to see Andy's mom put the 25 cents box on a table nearby.) Okay, boy. Let's go. And keep it casual. (Buster moves in a innocent fashion and then move forward. Woody is clinging to his side out of sight of any one) Not that casual. [Buster stops grinning and walks on towards the yard sale following him behind. The other toys went to the window sill and Buzz uses Lenny to see what's going on]"
"Hamm: Piggy bank, piggy bank. Coming through."
Rex: Is he out there?
Bo Peep: Can you see him?
Buzz Lightyear: There he is.
[Woody and Buster moves to the table with the 25 cent box on it. He climbs up to the table and hid behind a pepper sprayer as a man walk past whistling then run to the box and climb into it]
Rex: Oh! He's getting in the box.
Hamm: He's sellin' himself for 25 cents.
"Slinky: Oh, Woody. You're worth more than that."
Buzz Lightyear: Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Look. He´s got something. [They saw Woody pull up Wheezy into view] It's Wheezy.
Toys: Wheezy?
Rex: Hey. It's not suicide. It's a rescue.
"Woody: [Woody pushes Wheezy to the ground and Buster moves him a bit with his nose] Good boy, Buster. Hold still. (he put Wheezy in Buster's collar) There. There you go, pal."
"Wheezy: Bless you, Woody."
"Woody: All right, now, back to Andy's room. Hyah! [Buster moves forward following him]"
"Buzz Lightyear: Way to go, cowboy."
Hamm: Yea! Woodster!
Slinky: Golly bob howdy!
[Wheezy starts slip due to bobbing around so much]
Wheezy: Woody! I-I'm slippin'.
[Woody push Wheezy back in the collar but then Buster leaps over a toy and Woody falls off and lands on the ground. He watch as Buster runs with Wheezy still in his collar back into the house]
Girl Finds Woody
[Woody quickly freeze hide as a little girl comes over]
"Girl: Mommy! Mommy, look! Look at this! Mommy, look! It's a cowboy dolly!"
Rex: Hey! That's not her toy.
"Buzz Lightyear: No, no, no, no, no."
Slinky: What's that little gal think she's doin'?
"Girl: Mommy, Mommy! Can we get it, please? Mommy, please?"
"Mommy: Oh, honey. You don't want this toy. It's broken. [She takes Woody from her daughter and throws him away]"
Al Steals Woody
Woody's Voice Box: There's a snake in my boot. [A man hears his voice box and comes over to him and gasps when he saw him and picks him up]
"Al: Original hand-painted face. Natural-dyed, blanket-stitched vest! Hmm. A little rip. Fixable. Oh, if only you had your hand-stitched, polyvinyl... (he saw Woody's hat on the table and laughs with delight) A HAT!!! I found him! I found him! I found him! [He giggles until he heard Buster barking in the distance and gather the stuff he was buying as Andy's Mom approaches]"
Andy's Mom: Buster! Quiet down! Excuse me. Can I help you?
"Al: Uh, how much for all this stuff?"
Slinky: Yeah. You can help take his paws off my pal.
"Al: I'll give you, eh, 50 cents for all this junk."
"Andy's Mom: (seeing Woody) Oh. Now, h-how did this get down here?"
Buzz: Just hand her the sheriff. Nice and easy.
"Al: Oh, a pro. Very well. Five dollars."
Andy's Mom: I'm sorry. It's a old family toy.
"Buzz Lightyear: Now, just walk away."
Al: Wait.
Buzz Lightyear: The other way.
Al: Uh. I'll give you bucks for it.
Mr Potato Head: Fifty bucks ain't bad.
Andy's Mom: It's not for sale. [She put Woody in the case and locks him inside]
Al: Everything's for sale. O-Or trade. Uh. You like my watch?
Andy's Mom: Sorry.
Buzz Lightyear: He’s safe.
"Hamm: Way to go, Andy's mom!"
Mr Potato Head: Whew. That was close.
Slinky: All right. She showed him.
"Al: But, lady..."
"Andy's Mom: Molly. Don't touch that, please."
Al: Lady. Lady. Lady.
"Mr Potato Head: Yeah. Go home, Mr Fancy Car. [Al stumbles on a skateboard. Seeing it and looking at Andy's Mom with a grin, he got an idea]"
Buzz Lightyear: Hold on.
Hamm: Whassup?
"Rex: What is it, Buzz? [Al uses his foot to push the skateboard toward some boxes]"
"Andy's Mom: Molly. I'll be right here, sweetie. Oh! What now? [She heard a crash and went to see what made the noise. Al unlocks the case while she's not looking and grabs Woody]"
Mr Potato Head: What's happening down there?
Hamm: What's goin' on down there?
Slinky: What's he doin'?
Rex: I can't watch. Can someone cover my eyes?
"Buzz Lightyear: Oh, no. He's stealing Woody!"
Toys: What?!
Hamm: Stealin'?! W-Wait!
Rex: He can't take Woody. It's illegal.
Slinky: Where's he goin'?
Rex: Somebody! Do somethin'! [Buzz put Lenny down and runs to the drainpipe to slide down]
Bo Peep: Buzz! [Buzz reaches the ground and run to rescue Woody]
"Mr Potato Head: Get him, Buzz. [Buzz hides behind a table as Andy's mom walks past]"
"Andy's Mom: Okay, where's the red jacket?"
"[As Al put his bag in the trunk, Buzz runs to the mailbox and peep out from behind it as Al's car moves from the driveway. He runs to it and leaps onto the trunk. He saw the lock and turns it to open the hood but as he does, the hood flips up, knocking him off the trunk and onto the road. Buzz watches as chicken feathers flew out of the trunk just as the hood closes as the car drives away. Buzz pick up a feather and look at it. The toys look at the direction with shock and dismay at what has happened]"
"Bo Peep: Why would someone steal, Woody?"
"[The scene changes to Al's car rolling along down the road and inside the trunk Woody, get bumped around in the bag as the car stops. He hears Al opening the boot and bring out his bag. He walks to his apartment. Woody, peep out of it]"
[The man opens the door and went inside. The door has a sign on it which say NO CHILDREN ALLOWED.]
"[At Andy's room, Etch have draw a picture of Woody as the toys are trying to figure out who took him,]"
"Hamm: All right. Let's review this one more time. At precisely 8:32-ish. Exhibit ""A"". Woody was kidnapped. Exhibit ""B"". Composite sketch of the kidnapper. [Etch draws a false picture of Al who's got a beard]"
"Toys: Nah, that's not him."
Bo Peep: He didn't have a beard like that.
"Hamm: Fine. Uh, Etch. Give him a shave. [Etch redraws Al again but without the beard]"
Slinky: The kidnapper was bigger than that.
"Hamm: Oh, picky, picky, picky."
"Mr Potato Head: Let's just go straight to Exhibit F. The kidnapper's vehicle. [The crime scene remake was made using LEGO to make Andy's house and the small toy in a car is used to represent Al's car] Now, the vehicle fled the scene in this direction."
Hamm: Your eyes are in backwards. It went the other way.
Mr Potato Head: Hey. Put a cork in it.
"Rex: How do you spell ""FBI""? [he accidentally walk into the crime scene remake, messing it up]"
"Mr Potato Head: MY CRIME SCENE! [As Rex turns, his tail knock over the model of Andy's house]"
"Hamm: Oh, why don't you watch where you're goin', ""Godspilla""?"
Rex: I didn't know there was a crime scene.
"Buzz Lightyear: Excuse me. Excuse me. A little quiet, please. Thank you."
Hamm: Huh? [Mr Potato Head shrugs as the toys and Irelanders look confused at each other then walk over to Buzz who is typing some letters into Mr Spell via his keyboard to figure out the license plate's words LZTYBRN]
"Mr Spell: Lazy toy brain. Lousy try, Brian."
"Rex: What are you doing, Buzz?"
Buzz Lightyear: There was some sort of message encoded on that vehicle's ID tag.
Mr Spell: Liz try bran.
Mr Potato Head: It's just a licence plate. It's just a jumble of letters.
"Hamm: Yeah, and there are about million registered cars in the Tri-County area alone."
Mr Spell: Lou's thigh burn. [Buzz shook his head in dismay]
"Mr Potato Head: Oh, this can't help. Let's leave Buzz to play with his toys. [The toys start to leave Buzz when Mr Potato Head's comment give Buzz an idea]"
Buzz Lightyear: Toy. Toy. Toy. Hold on! [He types the letters up on Mr Spell. The toys stop walking and turn to watch Buzz type the letters on Mr Spell's keyboard then press the play button]
Mr Spell: Al's tea burned. Al's Toy Barn.
Toys: Huh?! Al's Toy Barn?!
[Buzz picks up the feather to look at it for the clues began to add up]
Buzz Lightyear: Etch! Draw that man in a chicken suit.
"[Etch does so and a picture of Al in his chicken costume appears on his screen, making everyone gasp in shock and Rex yelled in horror]"
Rex: AAHH! It's the chicken man!
Buzz Lightyear: That's our guy.
Hamm: I knew there was somethin' I didn't like about that chicken.
Al Calls Mr Konishi Part 1
"[The scene changes to Al in his chicken suit in his apartment, talking to someone on the phone]"
"Al: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'll be right there. And we're gonna do this commercial in one take. Do you hear me? Because I am in the middle of something really important. [He sighs and hangs up before turning his attention to Woody, who are in glass cases] (snickers) Oh... You, my little cowboy friend. Are gonna make me big buck-buck-bucks! [He laughs as he leaves the room.]"
Woody Tries To Escape
"[Woody, unfreeze and run to the door of his apartment and jump up but he can't reach the handle as it's too high for them to reach. He turn to the window and climb the chair and jump onto the window still and open the blinds. He looks down in shock to see that he's high up from the ground and at the top floor]"
Woody: Andy!
"[Down below, Al is getting into his car]"
Al: I can't believe I have to drive all the way to work. On a Saturday. All the way to work! [He drives off to his toy store which is only a 10 second drive away from his apartment]
[He run to a vent and Woody strains to move a screw but it won't budge so he tries pulling the vent]
Woody Meets The Roundup Gang
"[Then a opening noise pops, caught Woody's attention. He turns to see a box being opened and lots of big packing peanuts all over the floor]"
"Woody: What? Whoa! [He was suddenly getting scoop up by a horse which runs around the room, carrying Woody with it] (yells) Hey! Stop! Horsey, stop! Stop! Sit, boy! Stop it! Sit, I said! Whoa!"
[The horse stops and Woody fell off him and land on his head. A boot appears in front of him and a red haired cowgirl doll looks at him with excitement]
Jessie: YEEEEEEEEEEEHAAAAAAAAAAAAAW!!
Woody: (yells)
Jessie: IT'S YOU! IT'S YOU!! IT'S YOU! IT'S YOU! IT'S YOU! IT'S REALLY YOU!!!
Woody: What's me?
Jessie: Whoo! Whee! [She throws Woody forward to pull his pull-string and put her ear to his chest to listen to his voice box]
Woody's Voice Box: There's a snake in my boot!
Jessie: Ha! It is you!
"Woody: Please, stop saying that."
Jessie: Prospector said someday you'd come! Sweet mother of Abraham Lincoln! The Prospector! He'll wanna meet ya! [She whistles to the horse who ran over to the box and push out a box and bring it to Woody and Jessie]
"Jessie: Say, hello! To the Prospector!"
"[Woody, can only see the back of the box]"
Woody: I-It's a box.
Jessie: He's mint in the box! Never? Been opened!
"Voice: Turn me around, Bullseye. So I can see."
[Bullseye push the box around and the front revealed a prospector toy inside it. The words Stinky Pete the Prospector are beneath him. He gasps when he saw Woody]
"Stinky Pete: Why, the prodigal son has returned."
Jessie: YEEEEEEEEEEEHAAAAAAAAAAAAA!! It's you! It's you! You're here! IT'S YOU! IT'S YOU!! IT'S YOU!!!
Woody: [Woody strain himself free from Jessie's arms and stands] Okay. I'm officially freaked-out now.
Stinky Pete: Oh! We've waited countless years for this day. It's good to see you. Woody.
"Woody: Listen, I don't know what? Hey. How do you know my name?"
Jessie: Everyone knows your name. Woody.
[Woody look at them in confusion]
"Stinky Pete: Why, you don't know who you are. Do you? Bullseye."
"[Bullseye runs up, jumps on a chair and onto a drawer to push a switch which turn on some lights. Woody, turn and gasps for in front of them was a collection of pictures and merchandise of Woody on the wall]"
"Woody: That's me. [There also pictures and merchandise of Jessie, Bullseye and Stinky Pete on them. Woody look up to see a giant cardboard picture of himself which towers above him] Wow. [He look down to see books and TV show guide which has him on it with Bullseye] Holy cow."
"[Bullseye pushes a tape inside a tape player and Jessie uses her boot to press the remote and the TV turns on starting a TV show. Woody, look up to see the show's intro with wonder and curiousness]"
"Woody's Roundup Announcer: Cowboy Crunchies, the only cereal that's sugar-frosted and dipped in chocolate... proudly presents..."
Woody's Roundup
"Come on, it's time to play"
There's Jessie the Yodelin' Cowgirl
Jessie: Lookit! Lookit! That's me!
"Bullseye, he's Woody's house"
He's a smart one!
"Pete, the old prospector"
Stinky Pete: Has anyone seen my pickaxe?
[Stinky Pete facepalms and shook his head in embarrassment by the pick axe behind him comedy]
"And the man himself, of course"
It's time for Sheriff Woody
He's the very best
"He's the rootin'-est, tootin'-est cowboy in the wild, wild west"
Woody's Roundup
[Woody is amazed by this.]
Rescue Woody
"[Back in Andy's room, Rex is using his foot to change the TV channel for Al's Toy Barn commercial]"
Rex: I can't find it! It doesn't seem to be on any of these stations!
Buzz Lightyear: Keep looking.
Hamm: Ah. You're goin' too slow. Lemme take the wheel.
[Hamm rapidly presses the channel button and the commercials rapidly changes]
Rex: lt's too fast! How can you even tell what's on?
Hamm: I can tell.
[Hamm keeps changing the channels even when Al's commercial appeared]
Al: Toy and...
Buzz Lightyear: There it is! We made it!
Rex: Back! Back! Back!
Hamm: Too late. I'm in the 40s. Gotta go 'round the horn. It's faster. [He kept pressing until it reach Al's commercial and the toys and Irelanders stop him quickly before he change it again]
Al: ...and look for the giant chicken!
"Buzz Lightyear: Now, Etch! [Etch draws a map on his screen which shows the way to Al's Toy Barn. Buzz bends down and points to the statue of Al's big egg shaped chicken outside the toy store] That's. Where I need to go."
"Rex: You can't go, Buzz. You'II never make it there."
Buzz Lightyear: Woody once risked his life to save me. l couldn't call myself his friend. lf l weren't willing to do the same. So? Who's with me?
"Mrs Potato Head: [Mrs Potato Head packs Mr Potato Head's accessories in his part storage hatch in his back] I'm packing you an extra pair of shoes, and your angry eyes. Just in case."
Bo Peep: [Bo Peep walks over to Buzz] This is for Woody. When you find him. [She kisses Buzz]
Buzz Lightyear: (clears throat) All right. But l. l don't think it'll mean the same coming from me.
Wheezy: Mr. Buzz Lightyear. You just gotta save my pal. Woody. (wheezes)
Rocky: Me just strong and best vest.
"Buzz Lightyear: l'II do my best, son."
[Mrs Potato Head kisses Mr Potato Head's check before giving him his moustache]
"Mr Potato Head: Okay, fellas. Let's roII! [He, Hamm, Rex, Slinky, Buzz walk on the roof and uses Slinky's back as a bunging cord to jump down to the ground] Geronimo! [He lands on the ground and let Slinky's back go back up to Hamm who grabs it and jumps down]"
"Rex: You'd think with all my video game experience, l'd be feeling more prepared. [As he reaches for Slinky's back, he falls and hang on to it as it bounces up and down]"
Slinky: The idea is to let go.
Buzz Lightyear: We'll be back before Andy gets home.
Mrs Potato Head: Don't talk to any toy you don't know!
"Buzz Lightyear: To AI's Toy Barn and beyond! [He grabs Slinky's back and jumps down and he let it fly up to Slinky who leaps off, catching his back and jumps down.]"
[The camera moves up to a view of Al's apartment in the distance as the sun sets.]
Woody Hangs out with Roundup Gang
"[The scene changes to Al's apartment where Woody, Jessie, Bullseye and Stinky Pete are watching Woody's Roundup. Woody, are in awe at the show that has himself in it]"
"TV Jessie: They don't call this the old abandoned mine for nothin', Prospector. I reckon we oughta get outta here."
T.V Stinky Pete: Where's my gold? Hold on. I'll light me a candle. [He use a match to lit a fuse which begins to spread quickly] This sure is a fast-burnin' wick.
T.V Jessie: Blast us to smithereens! That there's dynamite!
T.V Stinky Pete: Holy tarnation!
"T.V Jessie: I'll call for help! (yodels) [Some critters arrive at the collapsed entrance] Hey, critters? Go get Sheriff Woody! Now scoot! [The critters run off. Meanwhile, Woody and Bullseye are painting a school house]"
"T.V Woody: Good job. Bullseye. I reckon the new school house, is finally done. [The critters arrived and told Woody about the problem] What's that? (gasps) Jessie and Prospector, are trapped in the old abandoned mine? And Prospector just lit a stick of dynamite thinkin' it was a candle? And now they're about to be blown? To smithereens?!"
Rabbit: Mmm-hmm.
T.V Woody: Ride like the wind. Bullseye!
"[Bullseye runs off with Woody out of town and into the desert. In the mine, Jessie and Stinky Pete are trying to put out the fuse]"
T.V Stinky Pete: You're fannin' the flames. Jessie. It takes brains. Bo put out that fire. [He sits on the flame but it only makes him jump up and down in pain] Yeow! My biscuits are burnin'!
[The scene cuts back to Woody and Bullseye who gallops over to the edge of a canyon and jump over it into the air and soar over it]
"Woody's Roundup Announcer: Will Woody and Bullseye land to safety? Can they reach Jessie and Stinky Pete in time?! Tune in next week for the exciting conclusion: ""Woody's Finest Hour""!"
"Woody: All right! All right! Next tape! [To his surprise however, Jessie sadly turns off The TV with her boot] Hey. Wait. Wait,. Wait. What? What happened? What happens next? Come on! Let's see the next episode!"
Stinky Pete: That's it.
Woody: What?
Stinky Pete: The show was cancelled after that. [He nudges his box to turn around]
"Woody: Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. What about the gold mine and the? And the cute little critters and the dynamite. That was a great show! I mean, why cancel it?"
Stinky Pete: Two words. Sput. Nik. Once the astronauts went up? Children only wanted to play with space toys.
"Woody: I know how that feels. But, still, my own show. And look at all this stuff!"
"Jessie: Didn't you know? Why, you're valuable property!"
"Woody: Oh, I wish the guys could see this. (he saw a yo-yo which has his face on it) ""Hey howdy hey!"" That's me. I'm on a yo-yo. [He then saw a game that has his face smiling and some balls besides it] Oh! Hey. Nice teeth. (he throws a ball at one of the teeth and it knocks it out) And yet? Still a good-lookin' guy. [He, Jessie and Bullseye laugh. Woody saw a bank game. He make the Prospector model launch a coin to a Woody model's hand that puts it in a barrel] Oh! It's a bank! Cool! [He went over to a bubble blowing toy which has his face on it and his hat for pushing down to get the bubbles going] Wh-Wh-What do you? You push the hat. And out co... Oh! Out come bubbles. Clever. [Jessie, Prospector, laugh while Bullseye pop a big bubble with his teeth] Oh, wow! Hey. What's this thing do? [He push down the spur with his boot and a toy snake pops out of it] (laughs) Ahaha, I get it. ""There's a snake in my boot."" Hey, Bullseye. Go long. Go long! [He shoots the snake out of the boot and Bullseye chases it, jumping onto a record player which starts playing it, making Bullseye going around on the record, sitting on it] A record player! Ha! Haven't seen one of these in ages. [He climb up to join Bullseye on the record player and starts walking it in one place. Jessie walk over and laugh at this antic] Okay. Now. Slow. [He and Bullseye start walking slowly on the record, making Jessie laugh even more]"
"Jessie: Oh, that's funny, Bullseye!"
Woody: [Woody pulls Jessie up on the record] Hop on! Cowgirl! Think fast! [He jumps over the needle and Jessie jumps over it too] Not bad.
Record Player: It's time for Woody's Roundup
He's the very best
"He's the rootin'-est, tootin'-est-- [Jessie jumps forwards on the needle with her hands and launch herself back onto the record]"
"Woody: (laughs) [He set the dial to fast and the record speeds up with Woody, Jessie and Bullseye running on it]"
"Jessie: Oh! Hey, look at us! We're a complete set!"
Stinky Pete: Now it's on the museum!
Woody: Museum?! [He stops running in surprise and slides into Jessie and Bullseye knocking them and himself off the record and onto the table] What museum?
Stinky Pete: THE museum! We're being sold to the Konishi Toy Museum in Tokyo!
Jessie: That's in Japan!
Woody: Japan? No. No. No. No. No. No. No. I can't go to Japan.
Jessie: (chuckles) What do you mean?
Woody: I gotta get back home to my owner. Andy. Hey. Look. Look. See?
[He lifts his boot to show Andy's name written on the sole of it]
Jessie: (gasps) He still has an owner.
"Stinky Pete: Oh, my goodness."
[Jessie begins to hyperventilate over this]
Jessie: No. Can't go. I can't go to storage again. I just can't!
Stinky Pete: Jessie. Jessie.
Jessie: (shaking his box frantically) I won't go back in the dark!
Woody: Wh-What's the matter? What's wrong with her?
Stinky Pete: Well? We've been in storage for a long time. Waiting for you.
Woody: Why me?
"Stinky Pete: The museum's only interested in the collection if you're in it, Woody. Without you, we go back into storage. It's that simple."
Jessie: IT'S NOT FAIR! How can you do this to us?!
"Woody: Hey. Look. I'm sorry. But, this is all a big mistake. You see? I was in this yard sale."
Stinky Pete: Yard sale? Why were you in a yard sale if you have an owner?
Woody: Well? I wasn't supposed to be there. I was trying to save another toy when--
Stinky Pete: Was it because you're damaged? Hmm? Did this Andy break you?
"Woody: Yeah, but... No. No. No. No! It was... It was an accident. I mean."
Jessie: Sounds like he really loves you.
Woody: It's not like that! Okay?! And I'm not going to any museum!
"Jessie: Well, I'm not going back into storage! (gasps)"
"[Then they heard some footsteps outside the door coming towards the room, as we hear doorbell rang.]"
Stinky Pete: Al's coming!
Woody: (gasp)
Stinky Pete: Go! Go on! Jessie!
[Jessie look down at the box nervously]
Jessie: Ohh! Ohh! Ohh!
Stinky Pete: Jessie. Look at me. I promise you'll come out of the box. Now! Go! Go!
"[Jessie close her eyes, took a deep breath and jumps into the box, followed by Stinky Pete and Bullseye while Woody run to their glass cabinets just in time before Al enters the room, holding a camera whilst humming]"
"Al: [as black mask on] It's showtime! [He places Stinky Pete, Jessie and Bullseye on a table which has a western town model on it before turning to Woody] (chuckles) Money, baby. Money, money, money. (chuckle) And now, the main attraction."
"[He opens the case and pull out Woody, unaware that a stem from Woody's ripped arm had caught up on a big handle which is used to hold the arms and began to come unravel. When Al places Woody besides Bullseye, he sees that Woody's arm is gone]"
"Al: (gasps and shouts) No! His arm! Where's his arm?! [He saw Woody's arm on the floor, picks it up and tries to put it back on but to no avail] Oh! No. No, no, no, no! Oh, what am I gonna do? Oh, I know. I know. [He picks up his phone and dials frantically] Come on, come on, come on, pick up the phone!"
[Geri's voice answers the phone]
Geri: Hello.
Al: It's me. It's Al. I got an emergency here.
"Geri: Well, I'm busy."
"Al: Yes, we're all busy, but... Look, it has to be tonight."
Geri: What? You've got to be kidding me.
"Al: All right, all right! But first thing in the morning. [He left the room.]"
Woody Freaks out and Lost His Arm
[Woody unfreezes and notices that his arm is gone]
Woody: AAAAHH! It's gone! I can't believe it! My arm is completely gone!
Stinky Pete: All right. Come here. Come on. Let me see that. Oh. It's just a popped seam. Easily repaired. You should consider yourself. Lucky.
Woody: LUCKY?! Are you shrink-wrapped?! I am MISSING! MY! ARM!
Jessie: Big deal. [She shoots a dart at Woody's poster stand up at the forehead] Let him go! I'm sure his precious Andy Is dying to play with an one-armed cowboy doll.
"Stinky Pete: Why, Jessie? You know he wouldn't last an hour on his condition. It's a dangerous world out there. For a toy."
Buzz Speech
"[Elsewhere, a car pass by a house. Buzz run out of some bushes towards a mailbox. He gestures to Rex who is covered in leaves. He runs to Buzz but as he did, the leaves fell off him except one when he reaches him. He shrugs with a sheepish chuckle. Slinky, Mr Potato Head, and Hamm run out of the bushes to Buzz when Hamm slips, rolls forward and his cork falls off, spilling his coins out on the pavement]"
"Hamm: All right. Nobody look, til I get my cork back in."
"Buzz Lightyear: Good work, men. Two blocks down, and only 19 more to go."
Rex: What?!
Other toys: 19?!
Mr Potato Head: Are we gonna do this all night? My parts are killing me.
"Buzz Lightyear: Come on, guys! Did Woody give up when Sid had me strapped to a rocket?"
Other toys: No...
Buzz Lightyear: No! And did he give up when you threw him out of the back of that moving van?
"Mr. Potato Head: Oh, ya had to bring that up."
"Buzz Lightyear: No, he didn't! We have a friend in need! And we will not rest until he's safe in Andy's room! Now, let's move out! [The ending of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" plays as American flag behind Buzz changes to black and white after he moves on, transitioning to a broadcast on Al's TV]"
Announcer: And that concludes our broadcast day.
[The TV turns static.]
Woody tries to Get His Arm Back
"[Al is fast asleep on the sofa, holding a bowl of Cheetos. His grip on the bowl starts loosen and falls on the floor. Woody unfreezes and looks to Al's shirt pocket where his arm is stored. He gracefully open the door of his glass case. Al snorted in his sleep. Woody hops down to the floor but as he tip-toed across to Al, he heard a crunching noise. He look down to see that he has stepped on a Cheeto. He look up to see Cheetos laying all over the floor in front of him. Gracefully, he tip-toed over the Cheetos and try not step on them when he hear a crunching sound behind him. He turns to see Bullseye stepped on the Cheetos]"
"Woody: Bullseye. Bullseye. Go. Go. Go. Go. Oh! Come on. You don't wanna help me. I'm the bad guy. You're gonna go back in storage. Because of me. Remember? Now, just go. [Bullseye licks Woody's face] Bullseye... All right. All right. But you have got to keep quiet. Now come on. [Woody and Bullseye tip-toes across the Cheetos and towards the side of the sofa] (whispers) Over here. Attaboy. Okay, Bullseye. Upsy-daisy. [Bullseye lifts him up to the sofa. Woody climbs on Al and reaches for his arm, trying not to lose his balance when Al suddenly giggles in his sleep. Woody look down to see Bullseye licking Al's hand which is covered in Cheeto flavor] Bullseye. Cut it out. Stop it. Stop it. Bullseye. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it! [Bullseye stops licking Al's hand and step back with a sorry look on his face. Woody continues to reach for his arm but as he slowly starts to pull it out, he heard a rumble and he look at Al's stomach. The rumble travels up his stomach to his head to which Al burps in Woody's face. Woody gags at the smell and use his hat to fan it away. He hold his breath and pull out his arm from Al's shirt pocket. Al snorts again and continue sleeping. Woody sighs with relief but as he about to climb down, the TV turns on suddenly, much to Woody's shock and surprise]"
"TV Intro: Woody's Roundup Come on, it's time to play~"
"Al: [Al wakes up with a start, knocking Woody to the floor] What?! No, officer! I swear! What? (gasps) [As the theme song plays in the background, Al gasps when he saw Woody on the floor and saw his glass cabinet empty. He picks Woody up and put him back in the glass cabinet] Oh, get in there. There you go. Cheap case. Where's the remote? Where is the remote? [As Al searches for the remote, Woody saw the remote under Jessie's glass cabinet and got shocked by the thought that she might turn the TV on before freezes when Al passes him] Why don't I put it in the same place everyti-- Oh, here it is. [He picks up the remote and turns off the TV. Yawning, he left the room, holding Woody's arm in his hand.]"
Woody Vs Jessie
[Woody turns to Jessie angrily and open his glass case to jump down to confront her]
"Woody: What's your problem?! Look, I'm sorry I can't help you guys out. Really, I am. But you didn't have to go and pull a stunt like that."
Jessie: What? You think I did that?
"Woody: Oh. Right, right. Yeah, the TV just happened to turn on. And the remote magically ended up in front of you!"
Jessie: You callin' me a liar?
"Woody: Well, if the boot fits."
Jessie: [Dangerously] Say that again.
Woody: [Enunciating] If the booT. FitS.
"Jessie: Alright, cowboy... [Bullseye hides in a Woody's Roundup cookie jar as Jessie lunges at Woody and began to fight him] How do ya like that?! Take it back! TAKE IT BACK!"
Woody: Don't think just 'cause you're a girl! I'm gonna take it easy on ya! (yells)
Stinky Pete: Jessie! Woody! You stop this at once! Ohhhh! [He and his box fell off a stand and onto the floor of the cupboard]
[They lift Stinky Pete's box up]
Stinky Pete: I don't know how that television turned on. But fighting about it isn't helping anything.
Woody: If I had both my arms.
"Stinky Pete: Well? The fact is, you don't. Woody. So I suggest you just wait until morning. The cleaner will come. Fix your arm."
Woody: And then? I'm outta here! [Bullseye lower his head sadly by Woody] Oh. No. No. Bullseye. Don't take it that way. It's just that Andy...
Jessie: Andy. Andy. Andy. That's all he ever talks about. You Know?
"[She walks away with a arm on Bullseye, leaving Woody alone with a sad sigh.]"
Crossing The Road
"[In the bushes, next morning, Buzz uses his karate chop action to move some leaves out of his way. The toys are behind him and look exhausted]"
Hamm: Hey. Buzz. Can we slow down? May I remind you that some of us are carrying over six dollars in change?
Rex: Losing health units. Must rest.
Buzz Lightyear: Is everyone present and accounted for?
Mr Potato Head: Not quite everyone.
Buzz Lightyear: Who's behind?
"Slinky: Mine. [Slinky's back end comes walking up slowly to the others then slump down, exhausted]"
Hamm: Hey. Guys! Why did the toys cross the road?
"Buzz Lightyear: Not now, Hamm."
Rex: Oh. I love riddles. Why?
Hamm: To get to the chicken on the other side! [Across the road is Al's Toy Barn]
Toys: Hooray!
"Rex: Yippee! The chicken! [A lot of cars came zooming past. One of them hit a can and it land on the pavement in front of the toys] Ah, well, we tried. [He turns to leave but Buzz grab his tail to bring him back]"
Buzz Lightyear: We'll have to cross.
Toys: What the... What?!
Mr Potato Head: You're not turning me into a mashed potato.
"Slinky: I may not be a smart dog, but I know what roadkill is."
"Buzz Lightyear: There must be a safe way. (He then saw something which gives him an idea. Later, the traffic lights change from green to red after some cars pass. A bunch of traffic cones are on the pavement) Okay. Here's our chance. Ready. Set. Go! (The cones then move across the road. Rex whimpers nervously in his cone. The Traffic lights turn from red to green and cars come rolling towards the toys and Irelanders) Go! (Everyone stop and dropped their cones. A car swerved to avoid them and went into some spikes on a driveway, punctuating the tires, Another car crashes into it) Drop! (They move on until Buzz heard the cars again) GO! (Some of them drop except Hamm and Mr Potato Head) I SAID, GO! (They drop and cars swerved to avoid the cones, results in a crash and a wheel rolling) Drop! (The toys walk on. As Hamm mutters to himself, a monster truck came zooming over his cone, making it spin around for a sec before stopping. Hamm shook himself and walked on. Buzz heard more cars coming) Go! (They do so and a car swerved around to avoid it then a truck with a concrete pipe which braked, making it's trailer move around in a big U turn) Drop! (The toys move on. Then as the trailer leans, the chains holding the pipe breaks and it roll off the trailer and onto the road. Mr Potato Head's shoe got stick on some gum. Mr Potato Head stops and search for his shoe until he finally touch it. As the pipe roll towards him, he strains to get his shoe free until he finally gets it free and ran to the other side just as the pipe rolled to the gum and got it stick to it's side. The toys arrived on the other side of the road and put the cones down)"
Mr Potato Head: That went well. [All the cars are all piled up and the pipe roll towards a pole and knocked it to the road]
"Buzz Lightyear: Good job, troops. We're that much closer to Woody. [The toys walks to Al's Toy Barn,]"
Fixing Woody
"[unaware that Al's apartment is on the other side and it's where Woody really is. Inside, a doorbell rang and Al opens the door. A old man carrying a briefcase is standing in the doorway]"
Al: Oh. Thank goodness. You're here.
Geri: Is the specimen ready for cleaning?
"[Geri put down his briefcase and flick two upper locks to open it. It opens up to move out into little presses. Geri takes Woody from his glass case and touch a button which reveals a mini hair saloon chair and put him on it. He remove his hat, press another button which open a hat stand and he put Woody's hat on it. He look through drawers until he found a pair of glasses and put them on. He then raise the chair up]"
"Al: So, uh, how long is this gonna take?"
Geri: You can't rush art. [He turn on a torch on his glasses and it shine bright]
"[The light vanish, revealing a backdrop of cows in a field. A shopping trolley with a cow's face and udders is moving towards Al's Toy Barn by Buzz pushing it. As they near the entrance, they saw a sign that said SORRY, WE'RE OPENED]"
Slinky: It's opened.
Mr. Potato Head: We're not preschool toys. Slinky. We can read.
[They saw a worker drinking a can while walking towards the door which opens with the moo sound effect and he goes in]
"Worker: Hey, Joe, you're late! We got a ton of toys to unload in the back."
Joe: All right. All right. I'm comin'. I'm comin'!
Worker: Come on! Let's get movin'!
Buzz Lightyear: All right. Let's go.
"Rex: But, the sign says it's closed!"
[They run to the door and jump on the mat trying to open the door]
Buzz Lightyear: No. No. No. No. All together. Now!
"[They jump together, grunting, and the door opens. As they run inside, Rex went over to a manual shelf and saw a Buzz Lightyear video game manual with a note saying ""WANT TO DEFEAT ZURG? SECRETS REVEALED!"" Rex giggles with excitement by this. The toys walk to the aisles and look at them in awe]"
Slinky: Whoa! Nelly! How are we gonna find Woody? In this place?
"Buzz Lightyear: (opening his helmet) Look for Al. We find Al. We find Woody. Now, move out! [They split up]"
Hamm: Woody!
Mr. Potato Head: Woody!
"[Geri is using a ear cleaner to clean Woody's eyes and ears. He spray a little pink paint on Woody's cheeks and using brown paint, he spray a bald spot on Woody's hair. Then he put down some close-up glass to Woody's shoulder and jiggling putting a thread in a needle, he sew the arm back on Woody's shoulder. He use a long thin strip of paper to polish Woody's boots. Using deeper brown paint, he paints over Andy's name on the sole of Woody's boot. He put Woody back into his glass case]"
Geri: There you go. [He chuckles as he closed it] He's for display only. You handle him too much. He's not gonna last.
"Al: It's amazing! You're a genius! He's just, like, NEW!"
Buzz Lightyear Aisle
[The scene changes to back in Al's Toy Barn where Buzz is running down the front of the aisles until he came across a aisle fill up with Buzz Lightyear toys]
"Buzz Lightyear: Wow. [Buzz walk down the aisle, amazed by the sight of his aisle. Then below the display stand, he saw a sign that said NEW UTILITY BELT] (wolf-whistles) I could use one of those."
"[He climbs up to the display stand and saw a new Buzz Lightyear toy standing tall and proud just like he did when he first came to Andy's room and met Woody. In another aisle, Rex and Mr Potato Head are walking down it. Rex is reading the manual as he walks]"
"Rex: You know. They make it so you can't defeat Zurg, unless you buy this book. It's extortion. That's what it is. [Mr. Potato Head pull out his ears so he won't hear Rex's jabbering] Hey. I always thought the golden sceptre was the only."
Rex and Mr. Potato Head: Aaaah!
[Hamm and Slinky arrives in a toy car]
Hamm: I thought we could search in style.
"Mr. Potato Head: Nice going there, Hamm. (he step in and push Hamm aside) So, how about letting a toy, with fingers drive? [He starts driving the car and bump into a shelf then reverses into another shelf then as he drove off, he knocked over a pile of buckets of soldiers which fell over to the floor.]"
Buzz Vs Buzz
"[Back at the display stand, Buzz looks at his doppelganger with a curious expression]"
Buzz Lightyear: Am I really that fat?
[He saw the doppelganger's new utility belt and whistles. He reached down to touch it when his doppelganger suddenly grabs his hand and swing him to the ground]
Utility Belt Buzz: Hiya!
Buzz Lightyear: Ow! What are you doing?
Utility Belt Buzz: You're in direct violation of code 6404. 5... Stating all space rangers are to be in hypersleep until awakened by authorized personnel.
"Buzz Lightyear: Oh, no."
"Utility Belt Buzz: [Utility Belt Buzz pushes Buzz to the glass wall, his face pressed against it] You're breakin' ranks, ranger. (he open his wrist communicator and talks into it) Buzz Lightyear to Star Command. I've got an AWOL space ranger."
"Buzz Lightyear: (embarrassed, remembering his former behavior) Tell me. I wasn't this deluded."
Utility Belt Buzz: [Utility Belt Buzz heard him and presses his face to the glass again] No back talk! I have a laser. And I will. Use it!
"Buzz Lightyear: You mean the laser that's a light bulb? [He presses the laser button, making it beeps loudly. Utility Belt Buzz gasps and leaps onto a model of a planet above Buzz]"
"Utility Belt Buzz: Has your mind been melded? You could've killed me, space ranger! Or should I say? ""Traitor""! [He aims his laser at Buzz's forehead whilst Buzz looks on in annoyance and un-amusement]"
Buzz Lightyear: I don't have time for this.
Utility Belt Buzz: Halt! I order you to halt!
"[Buzz open a door to the display and jumps down to the floor. But just as he's about to walk away, Utility Belt Buzz pounces on him. The two Buzzes fight until the newer one overpowers the old one and push him towards a special box]"
Buzz Lightyear: Listen to me. Listen. Wait. Wait. Wait.
[Utility Belt Buzz stop pushing and Buzz went straight into the box.]
Barbie Aisle
"[Meanwhile, the toys are rolling down a pink aisle, looking for Al, Woody,]"
"Slinky: We've been down this aisle, already."
Mr. Potato Head: We've never been down this aisle. It's pink!
Slinky: Face it. We're lost.
Hamm: Ooh! Back it up. Back it up.
[They reverse back and they look to see lots of Barbie dolls having a pool party]
Barbie Doll #1: What a great party!
"[Rex, Slinky, Hamm and Mr Potato Head's mouths drops in awe at the sight]"
Barbie Dolls: How low can you go? How low can you go?
Barbie Doll #2: (giggles) Stop splashing me!
Hamm: Excuse me. Ladies. Does anyone know where we might find the Al of Al's Toy Barn?
"Tour Guide Barbie: I can help! [she slides down the slide and into the car next to Mr Potato Head] I'm Tour Guide Barbie! Please! Keep your hands, arms, and accessories, inside the car! And no flash photography! Thank you!"
Mr. Potato Head: (caught himself on what he's doing) I'm a married spud. I'm a married spud. I'm a married spud.
"Hamm: Then, make room for the single fellas! [he climbs over Mr Potato Head and lands next to Tour Guide Barbie as she starts to drive the car down the aisle and went onto another aisle]"
"Tour Guide Barbie: To our right, is the Hot Wheels aisle. Developed in 1967, the original series had 16 cars, including the Corvette."
"Slinky: Uh, beg your pardon, ma'am. But, where's Al's office?"
"Tour Guide Barbie: Please. Hold all questions, until the end of the tour. Thank you!"
"Rex: WAH! It says, how you defeat Zurg! Look! Guys! [he puts the manual in front of Tour Guide Barbie, Hamm and Mr. Potato Head, blocking their view and the windscreen]"
"Slinky: Hey, Rex!"
"Tour Guide Barbie: Excuse me, sir."
"Mr. Potato Head: Get this outta here. ""Geekosaur."""
"[But when Rex move the manual from the windscreen, they saw a ball stand]"
Slinky: Look out!
Hamm: Oh! Stop. Stop. Stop!
[Barbie swerves the car to the right but it hits the the stand and balls spill out on them. They tried to get away but the balls caused the car to spin around in circles]
"Hamm: Turn into the spin, Barbie!"
"[The Buzz Lightyear video game manual slips out of Rex's tiny hand and flies to the ground, sliding under a shelf, out of Rex's reach]"
Rex: Aah! My source of power! No! Come back! DAAH!!! Hey! [he runs after the car and the others] Wait up! Hey! Come on! [Mr. Potato Head looks at a side mirror and sees Rex's reflection in it with the words said OBJECTS IN MIRROR ARE MUCH CLOSER THAN THEY APPEAR] Slow down! Dinosaur overboard! Slow down! WAAH!!!
"[Barbie stops the car and Rex tumbles in headfirst, his legs dangled in the air]"

Buzz Tied his Box
"[Back at the Buzz Lightyear aisle, Utility Belt Buzz tied Buzz into a cardboard spaceship and put him in it]"
Buzz Lightyear: Ow! Listen to me! Listen to me! You're not really a space ranger! You're a toy! We're all toys! Do you hear me?!
"Utility Belt Buzz: Well, that should hold you til the court martial."
[He put Buzz on a shelf and walks away]
Buzz Lightyear: Let! Me! GO! You don't realize what you're doing! (grunts)
[The other toys arrives in the Buzz Lightyear aisle]
"Tour Guide Barbie: And this is the Buzz Lightyear aisle. Back in 1995, shortsighted retailers did not order enough dolls to meet demand."
Hamm: Hey! Buzz!
Utility Belt Buzz: Halt! Who goes there?!
"[He aim his laser at them, making Barbie stop the car just in front of Utility Belt Buzz]"
"Mr. Potato Head: Quit clowning around, and get in the car!"
Rex: Buzz! Buzz! I know how to defeat Zurg!
[Utility Belt Buzz turn off his laser upon hearing this]
Utility Belt Buzz: You do?
Rex: Come on. I'II tell you on the way.
"[Inside the box, Buzz saw this confusion and tries to call out to them but they can't hear him from outside]"
Buzz Lightyear: (muffled) No! No! Guys! You've got the wrong Buzz! YOU'VE! GOT! THE WRONG! BUZZ!!!
"Hamm: Say? Where'd you get the cool belt, Buzz?"
"Utility Belt Buzz: Well, slotted pig, they're standard issue."
"[They drive away, leaving Buzz behind in the box]"
Buzz Lightyear: NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
Al Call Mr. Konishi part 2
"[Back in his apartment, Al takes pictures of The Roundup Gang and the merchandise. He look at the photos with delight and glee]"
"Al: (laughs) It's, like, printing my own money. [His phone rings and he answers it] Yeah, what?"
Mr. Konishi: Al McWhiggin.
"Al: Oh, Mr Konishi. Yes, uh, I-I have the pictures right here. In fact, I'm in the car right now on my way to the office to fax them to you. I'm goin' through a tunnel! I'm breakin' up! [As he left the room,]"
Woody Tries To Go
[the Roundup Gang unfreezes]
"Woody: Oh. Wow. Will you look at me? It's, like, I'm fresh out of the box! Look at this stitching. Andy's gonna have a hard time rippin' this. (to Jessie who is still frowning at Woody for wanting to go back home to Andy) Hello! Hi! Hello!"
"Jessie: Great. Now you can go. [She turns, hop off the table and walks off to the window]"
Woody: (sarcastic) Well? What a good idea.
[Woody look towards the air vent which is his only way out. He felt something bump him and he turn back to see Bullseye looking at him sadly]
"Stinky Pete: Woody. Don't be mad at Jessie. She's been through more than you know. Why not make amends before you leave, huh? It's the least you can do."
"[Woody look towards Jessie sitting on the window still, then back at Bullseye who look at him as to say Please, Woody]"
Woody: (sighs) All right. But I don't know what good it'll do.
When Somebody Loved Me
"[He jump from the table and went over to Jessie, climbing onto the chair next to her and the window]"
Woody: Hey. Whatcha doin' way up here?
"Jessie: I thought I'd get one last look at the sun, before I get packed away again."
"Woody: Look, Jessie. I know you hate me for leaving, but I have to go back. I'm still Andy's toy. Well, if you knew him, you'd understand. You see, Andy's a..."
"Jessie: Let me guess. Andy's a real special kid. And to him you're his buddy, his best friend. And when Andy plays with you, it's, like. Even though you're not moving. You feel like you're alive. Because, that's how he sees you."
Woody: Whoa. How did you know that?
Jessie: Because Emily was just the same. She was my whole world.
"[A flashback begins featuring Jessie with Emily, a little girl with red hair in a ponytail and wearing a red cowgirl hat. She picks up Jessie and carry her. She puts Jessie on a toy horse and carries them in her hand]"
When somebody loved me
Everything was beautiful
Every hour we spent together
Lives within my heart
And when she was sad
I was there to dry her tears
"And when she was happy, so was I"
When she loved me
"[Emily takes Jessie to a tree which has a tire swing tied to it. She starts swinging on the tire, holding Jessie's hands in her hands. She then dances around and fell into a pile of leaves]"
Through the summer and the fall
"We've had each other, that was all"
Just she and I together
Like it was meant to be
And when she was lonely
I was there to comfort her
And I knew
She loved me
"[Jessie is on Emily's bed pillow when Emily grabs it which makes Jessie fall behind the bed. Jessie came to alive and crawl over to see Emily and another girl doing fingernail painting. Jessie is confused by this activity. As the years went by, Jessie watches in dismay as Emily start preferring fingernail painting and pop music to cowgirls and ponies. Feeling neglectful, Jessie lies on the floor under the bed and got dusty as more stuff appears under the bed, neglectful too by Emily]"
So the years went by
I stayed the same
But she began to drift away
I was left alone
Still I waited for the day
"When she'd say, ""I will always love you."""
"[Then Emily drops her makeup stuff and they roll under the bed. Jessie saw this and freezes, bring back her smile. Emily reaches for her stuff and pull out Jessie from under the bed and and look at her. Later, she took a drive with Jessie in her bag. Jessie smiles up at her, thinking that she and Emily are doing what they usually do again as she closes her eyes]"
Lonely and forgotten
I'd never thought she'd look my way
And she smiled at me and held me
Just like she used to do
Like she loved me
When she loved me
[Emily stops near the tree with the tire swing and walk over to some boxes and a trailer. She puts Jessie and some cowboy stuff into a box. Jessie unfreezes and look through a holder to see Emily getting into the car and drives away whilst Jessie watches sadly]
When somebody loved me
Everything was beautiful
Every hour we spent together
Lives within my heart
When she loved me
"[After the flashback ends, Woody, is look sorry and surprised about this]"
Jessie: You never forget kids like Emily. Or Andy. (whispers) But they forget you.
"Woody: Jessie, I. I didn't know."
Jessie: Just go.
Woody Decide To Stay
[Woody gets off the windowsill and onto the floor and walks over to the air vent. He unscrews the bolt and opens the cover]
"Stinky Pete: How long will it last, Woody? Do you really think Andy is going to take you to college? Or on his honeymoon? Andy is growing up, and there's nothing you can do about it. [Woody bows his head down, feeling conflicted on what to do] It's your choice, Woody. You can go back. Or you can stay with us. And last forever. You'll be adored by children for generations."
"Woody: [Woody look at the dark vent in front of him. He didn't move into it. Bullseye walk over to him sadly and Woody rub his mane to comfort him] Who are you? To break up the Roundup gang? [Bullseye and Stinky Pete smile at this decision Woody shut the grille. The sound caught Jessie's attention and she look towards Woody who smiles at her, showing that he decided to go to the museum which makes her smile in return.]"
Buzz And The gang Searching For Woody
"[In Al's office, Hamm and Potato Head look in a box]"
"Hamm: Hey, Woody, are you in here?"
Mr. Potato Head: Nah. This one's empty. Two.
Slinky: Woody!
Mr. Potato Head: Woody!
Hamm: Woody!
[Slinky hop onto Al's desk and went over to some Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots]
"Slinky: Pardon me, gentlemen. But, have either of you seen a cowboy doll with a bad arm?"

Both Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots: Nice singing by guys.
"Blue Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robot: Why, no. I haven't talk to me!"
Red Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robot: HEY! He was talkin' to me!
"Blue Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robot: NO, HE WAS TALKIN' TO ME!!!"
"Red Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robot: WHY, YOU, I'LL PUNCH YOU! [The two robots punches each other until the red one's head spins up, making Slinky back up in horror]"
"Rex: You see. All along, we thought the way into Zurg's fortress was through the main gate. But in fact, the secret entrance is to the left! Hidden in the shadows."
"Utility Belt Buzz: (open his wrist communicator to ""type"" in notes) To the left and in the shadows. Got it. [Then they hears a voice speaking in English outside the room]"
"Slinky: Quick, someone's coming."
"Utility Belt Buzz: Everyone! Take cover! [The toys hide under the desk just as Al enters, talking on his phone]"
"Al: No. It was a big pile-up. But, I don't want to bore you with the details. Yes. Now, let me confirm your fax number. [He went to his fax machine and start typing in the number] W-W-Wait. Slow. That's a lot of numbers. No. I got it."
[The toys peep out from the side of the desk to look at Al]
Slinky: (whispering) It's him.
Hamm: (whispering) The chicken man.
Utility Belt Buzz: (looking at Al in confusion) Funny. He doesn't look like poultry.
Slinky: That's the kidnapper. All right.
"Utility Belt Buzz: A kidnapper! An agent of Zurg if, I ever saw one."
"[Back at the Buzz Lightyear aisle, Buzz is still trapped in his box and jolted around to get free, The box fell off the shelf and onto the floor. Buzz kicks the bottom of the box open, freeing his legs. In the office, Al faxes a picture of Woody in the fax machine]"
Al: And the piece de resistance! I promise the collection will be the crown jewel of your museum. [The picture lands on the floor and the toys see it]
Slinky: (gasps) It's Woody.
Al: Now that I have your attention. Imagine we added another zero to the price. Huh?
"Mr. Konishi: I don't care! Yes, yes, yes, yes!"
Al: What?
Mr. Konishi: I pay anything you want. Anything.
Al: YES!!! YES!!! You got a deal!! I'll be on the next flight to Japan!
"Utility Belt Buzz: Quick. Get into the poultry man's cargo unit. He'll lead us to Zurg. Move. Move. Move! [The toys jumps into Al's bag, followed by Utility Belt Buzz, thinking that he'II lead them to Woody,]"
Al: Don't touch my mustache! (scats with joy)
Buzz Lightyear Escape
[Buzz is untying himself from the straps when he heard Al's scatting. He went to the end of the aisle with a glare and saw Al sliding out of his office with a smile on his face]
Al: Al! You are rich! Rich! Rich! Rich! (cackles)
"Buzz Lightyear: [Buzz gasps when he saw Rex's tail poking out of Al's bag. As Al went down the store, Buzz chases on an aisle and slips over the balls the toys had spilled earlier. He gets up and jump on the sports stuff, released a joystick so that he can jump from it, bounce on a trampoline and grab a monkey zipline which moves down towards the entrance where Al is exiting but as he let go of the zipline and leaps towards the doors]"
Silly Ideas
"[Across the road, Al gets out, leaving his bag in his car]"
Rex: Aah! He didn't take the bag!
"Utility Belt Buzz: No time to lose! [He jumps outta the bag and run to the door. He tried to pull the handle but it won't budge. He climbs to the door window and saw Al going into the lift] He's ascending in the vertical transporter. [He jumps down, opening his wings and grabs Rex and Potato Head's hands] All right, everyone. Hang on. We're gonna blast through the roof."
Rex: Uh. Buzz?
Utility Belt Buzz: To infinity. And beyond! [He tries to fly but nothing happens]
"Mr Potato Head: What are you? Insane!? We're wasting time! Stand still, Godzilla. [He climb up onto Rex's head and strains to pull the lock]"
"Utility Belt Buzz: I-I don't understand. Somehow, my fuel cells have gone dry. [He put his hand, pressing a switch which unlocks the door, sending Mr Potato Head fall over backwards onto the seat]"
Mr Potato Head: Aaaaaah!
Hamm: (laughs)
"[The door is opened and Utility Belt Buzz step out and turn on his laser to scan the area to see if it's clear. Once he done it, he ran over to the door and saw the elevator arrow going all the way to the 23rd floor]"
Utility Belt Buzz: Blast! He's on level 23.
Slinky: How are we gonna get up there?
Rex: Maybe if we find some balloons. We could float to the top.
"Mr Potato Head: Are you kidding? I say we stack ourselves up, push the intercom, and pretend we're delivering a pizza."
Hamm: How about a ham sandwich? With fries and a hot dog.
Rex: What about me?
Hamm: Ah. You can be the toy that comes with the meal.
Elevator Part 1
"Utility Belt Buzz: Troops! Over here! [He went to a grill on the left and pull the cover off it and put it to the side] Just like you said, lizard man. ""In the shadows to the left."" Okay. Let's move! [They head inside the vent to find woody] (talking into his wrist communicator) Mission log. Have infiltrated enemy territory without detection. And are making our way through the bowels of Zurg's fortress."
Hamm: You know? I think that Buzz aisle went to his head.
[They came to a vent junction and Utility Belt Buzz turn on his laser to choose which way to go]
Slinky: Oh. No. Which way do we go?
Utility Belt Buzz: (pointing to the left) This way.
Mr. Potato Head: What makes you so sure?
"Utility Belt Buzz: I'm Buzz Lightyear. I'm always sure. [Then the vents started to shake and rumble around the toys] We've been detected. The walls! They're closing in! Quick! Help me prop up, vegetable man. Or we're done for!"
Mr. Potato Head: Hey! Hey!! Put me down! You moron!
"Rex: Hey, guys! Look! It's not the walls! It's the elevator!"
[They look to see the elevator going down until it stops. They went over and look up at the shaft which is a long way up]
Utility Belt Buzz: Come on. We've got no time to lose. Everyone. Grab hold! [He pull out a rope handle and toss it into Mr. Potato Head's hand and then pull out two red handles to which magnets appear on them. He stick them to the metal surface and starts climbing up]
Toys: Huh? Huh?
Hamm: Uh. Buzz? Why not just take the elevator?
Utility Belt Buzz: They'll be expecting that.
"[Outside, Buzz is running under a traffic cone towards the door when he saw some footprints on the ground which leads to the vent where he heard some clanging and Rex yelling]"
"Rex: Hey, Buzz! Stop! Slow down!"
"[Eyes narrowed, Buzz walk over to the vent.]"
Al Packed Up
"[In his apartment, Al is loading boxes on a trolley while talking on his phone]"
Al: To overnight six packages to Japan is. How much? What? That's in yen? Right?
"Mrs. Konishi: No, dollars."
Al: Dollars?! D'OH! You are deliberately taking advantage of people in a hurry! You know that?! All right. I don't. I don't. I. Look. I'm. I'll do it. All right. Fine! I'll have the stuff waiting in the lobby. And you'd better be here in 15 minutes. Because I have a plane to catch! Do you hear me? [He left the room]
Woody Excited To Go Japan
[The toys unfreeze]
Jessie: Whoo-hoo! We're finally going! Can you believe it!?
"Stinky Pete: Ha-ha! That's custom-fitted foam insulation you'll be ridin' in, Bullseye. First class all the way!"
Woody: You know what? I'm actually excited about this. I mean it. I really am!
"Stinky Pete: And, why shouldn't you be?"
Jessie: YEE-HAH!
Woody: (laughs)
[He and Jessie start dancing on the floor]
Jessie: Swing your partner! Do-si-do! Look at you! Dancing cowboy!
Stinky Pete: Look! I'm doing the box step! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! (laughs)
Elevator Part 2
"[Back at the shaft, Utility Belt Buzz is still climbing up with the toys holding onto his line. Coins start to fall out of Hamm's slot]"
Hamm: Uh-oh. Hey! Head's up down there!
Slinky: WHOA! Pork bellies are fallin'.
"Mr. Potato Head: Hey! How much farther, Buzz?"
Utility Belt Buzz: (strains) Half. Way. There.
Rex: My arms can't hold on much longer!
"[He starts slipping down on top of the other toys, dragging them including Utility Belt Buzz down slowly]"
"Utility Belt Buzz: Too heavy. (he got an idea, remembering something) What was I thinking? My anti gravity servos! [He presses a button on his utility belt and at the same time, there's some whirring noises down below] Hang tight, everyone. I'm going? To let go? Of the wall."
Toys: Oh! What?!
Mr. Potato Head: He wouldn't!
Utility Belt Buzz: One.
Hamm: He would!
Utility Belt Buzz: Two.
"Toys: NO!!! DON'T, BUZZ!!! LET'S THINK ABOUT THIS!!!"
"Utility Belt Buzz: Three! [He let go of the wall and he, the toys fall down onto the elevator which has been moving up] To infinity and beyond! [He saw the 23rd level approaching from above] Approaching destination. Reengaging gravity. [He turn off his belt and the elevator reaches the 23rd level. Utility Belt Buzz 2 jumps off it and scan the vent with his laser to see if it's clear] Area secure. [The toys walk slowly off the elevator, feeling woozy from the fall before] It's okay, troops. The antigravity sickness will wear off momentarily. Now, let's move! [He runs off]"
"Mr. Potato Head: Remind me to glue his helmet shut, when we get back."
[They walk on.]
Introducing Sheriff Woody
[Woody and The Roundup Gang are having fun doing their cowboy things. Woody peeks out of a box]
"Woody: How about givin' me a little intro there, Jessie?"
Jessie: Introducing the high-ridin'-est cowboy around...
"Woody: (from inside the box) You forgot ""rootin'-tootin'-est""!"
"Jessie: The high-ridin'-est, rootin'-tootin'-est cowboy hero of all time... Sheriff Woody!"
"[Woody walks out of the box, wearing a kooky smile on his face. He tilt his hat and walks over to Jessie]"
"Woody: Say, little missy? You notice any trouble around these parts?"
Jessie: Nary a bit. Not with Sheriff Woody around.
"Woody: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! I got it! I got it! This is great! Okay! The bandits got the critters tied up in the burning barn, and now for the best part! (in Critters voices) Help us! The barn's on fire! (normal voice) I've got ya, critters. [He enters the box and emerges, holding an handful of packing peanuts] No need to worry. Woody saves the day again!"
Jessie: [plays the guitar] ♪ Someone want... ♪
"Stinky Pete: Jessie, stop singing. Stop it! Leave the guitar alone."
Woody: Why not.
Stinky Pete: Because I said so.
Jessie: YEEE-HAH!!
"Woody: Now! Where's my trusty steed Bullseye? I have to ride off into the sunset... Ohh! [Bullseye sweeps him off his feet] Ride like the wind, Bullseye! [He falls off Bullseye's back with the saddle. Bullseye looks down, cover himself as if he's naked and walks off on two legs, embarrassing]"
"[Jessie bends down to help Woody up, accidentally tickling him]"
"Woody: W-Watch it. Wait, wait. I'm ticklish, okay?"
"Jessie: Oh, you are?"
"Woody: No. No, no, no. Cut it out. [Jessie starts tickling Woody much to his protest while Stinky Pete laughs at it with a smile] Stop it. Stop it, stop it. No, please. Please! No! No, no! Stop it! Stop it!"
Found Woody
"[Inside the vent, Utility Belt Buzz runs ahead and scans the area as the toys walk wearily behind him]"
"Utility Belt Buzz: (talking into his wrist communicator) Mission log. Have reached Zurg's command deck. But, no sign of him or his wooden captive."
[Then they heard Woody's voice through the vent]
Woody: Please! No!
Slinky: That's Woody! (howls)
Utility Belt Buzz: This way! [They runs towards the cover]
Woody: Please! Please! No! No! No! No! No!
Mr Potato Head: Buzz. Can you see? What's going on?
Woody: I'm begging you!
Jessie: Take that!
Woody: I'm begging you! No more!
[Utility Belt Buzz uses one of Mr. Potato Head's eyes to see what's going on through the bars of the grill]
Mr Potato Head: To the left. No. Your left.
Jessie: Take that!
Woody: Please! You're killin' me!
Mr. Potato Head: Take it up. Higher.
Utility Belt Buzz: What's happening?
Mr. Potato Head: [frightened] Oh! It's horrible! They're torturing him!
Toys: (gasp)
"Rex: What are we gonna do, Buzz?!"
"Utility Belt Buzz: Use your head! [In seconds, they are using Rex as a battering ram]"
Rex: But I don't wanna use my head!
"[They charged out through the cover and into the apartment, crashing into the box on the way]"
Stinky Pete: What's going on here?!
"Woody: Buzz, guys! Hey! How did you find me?"
Utility Belt Buzz: Watch yourself!
"[He pounces on Woody, pinning him down to the floor]"
Slinky: We're here to spring ya! Woody!
Stinky Pete: Aaaaah!
"[Hamm jumps on the Stinky Pete's box, knocking it over]"
Hamm: You heard of kung fu? Well! Get ready for pork CHOP!
Mr Potato Head: Prepare to meet MR. ANGRY EYES!
"[But instead of his angry eyes, Mr Potato Head put his extra shoes on and walk into a cupboard, leaving Jessie in bewilderment at this antic]"
"Woody: Hold it, now! Hey! You don't understand! These are my friends!"
"Rex: Yeah, we're his friends!"
"Woody: No, Rex! I mean, they're my friends! [Slinky and Bullseye growled at each other]"
Jessie: Hey. Stop it. You leave him alone. Springy dog! Hey!
Slinky: [Slinky wraps himself around Jessie and Bullseye] Grab Woody! And let's go!
Woody: [Utility Belt Buzz does so] Fellas! Hold it! Buzz! Put me down!
Mr Potato Head: Retreat!
Rex: Quick! To the vent!
"Hamm: Alright, let's go!"
Jessie: They're stealing him.
Stinky Pete: No!
[The toys yell as they run towards the vent until....]
Buzz Lightyear: Hold it right there!
Toys: Buzz?!
Utility Belt Buzz: You again!
Buzz Lightyear: Woody! Thank goodness you're all right.
"Woody: Buzz, what is going on?"
Utility Belt Buzz: Hold on! I am Buzz Lightyear. And I am in charge of this detachment.
Buzz Lightyear: No. I am Buzz Lightyear.
Utility Belt Buzz: I am Buzz Lightyear!
Buzz Lightyear: I am Buzz Lightyear!
[Woody look confused at this]
Woody: So? Who's the real Buzz?
Buzz Lightyear and Utility Belt Buzz: I AM!
Utility Belt Buzz: Don't let this impostor fool you! He's been trained by Zurg himself to mimic my every move.
"[Buzz opens his doppelganger's helmet and he began to choke and gasping for air just like the old one did when Woody opened his helmet. Woody, and the toys look at Buzz in confusion and uncertainty until Buzz lifted his foot to show the name ""ANDY"" written on the bottom]"
Toys: Buzz! [Woody shake his hand and Buzz patted Slinky on the head]
"Slinky: I had a feelin' it was you, Buzz. My front end just had to catch up with my back end. (chuckles)"
"Utility Belt Buzz: [Utility Belt Buzz closes his helmet and stand up, looking confused at this] Will somebody please explain what's going on?"
"Buzz Lightyear: It's all right, space ranger. (he whispers) It's a code 546."
Utility Belt Buzz: (gasps) You mean it's a?
Buzz Lightyear: Yes.
Utility Belt Buzz: And he's a?
"Buzz Lightyear: Oh, yeah."
"Utility Belt Buzz: [Utility Belt Buzz gasps and runs to Woody, bows and grab his hand] Your majesty!"
Woody Stays
[Woody chuckles awkwardly and took his hand away]
Buzz Lightyear Woody. You're in danger here. We need to leave now.
Rex: Al's selling you to a toy museum. In Japan!
"Woody: I know. It's okay, Buzz. I actually wanna go."
Rex: What?!
Mr Potato Head: Are you crazy?!
"Woody: Look. The thing is... I'm a rare Sheriff Woody doll. And these guys, are my Roundup gang."
Buzz Lightyear: Woody. What are you talking about?
"Woody: What am I talking about? Woody's Roundup! O! It's this great old TV show. And I was the star. [He uses his boot to press the remote to turn on the TV which plays Woody's Roundup with footage of Woody riding Bullseye] See? Now, look! Look! Look at me! See!? That's me!"
Hamm: This is weirdin' me out.
Woody: Buzz. It was a national phenomenon. And there was all this merchandise that just got packed up. Oh. You should've seen it. There was a record player. And a yo-yo! Buzz! I was a yo-yo!
"Mr Potato Head: ""Was""?"
"Buzz Lightyear: Woody. Stop this nonsense, and let's go!"
"Woody: Nah. Buzz... (sighs) I can't go. I can't abandon these guys. They need me. To get into this museum. Without me, they'll go back into storage. Maybe forever!"
Buzz Lightyear: Woody. You're not a collector's item. You're a child's plaything. You. Are. A TOY!!
"Woody: For how much longer?! One more rip, then Andy's done with me! And what do I do then? Buzz! Huh? You tell me!"
Buzz Lightyear: Somewhere in that pad of stuffing is a toy who taught me that life's only worth living if you're being loved by a kid. And I traveled all this way to rescue that toy. Because I believed him.
Woody: Well? You wasted your time. [Woody turns his back on Buzz. The toys look dismayed at Woody's decision]
"Buzz Lightyear: Let's go, everyone."
Slinky: What about Woody?
Buzz Lightyear: He's not coming with us. [Buzz walks very upset to the vent]
Rex: But. But Andy's was coming home tonight.
Buzz Lightyear: Then we'd better make sure we're there waiting for him. [The toys and Utility Belt Buzz enter the vent. Slinky takes a sad look at Woody before entering. Buzz looks back at the Woody as Woody look toward Buzz]
"Woody: I don't have a choice, Buzz. This is my only chance."
"Buzz Lightyear: To do what, Woody? Watch kids from behind glass and never be loved again? Some life."
"[He enters the vent, shutting the grill behind him. Woody didn't know what to say due to feeling terrible of turning his back on Buzz and the gang]"
TV Woody: Is everybody okay?
TV Jessie: Sheriff Woody! I knew you'd make it!
"TV Woody: Now, remember, deputies. The real treasures are your friends and family. Before I go, kids, I want to share somethin' special with you... for the times when I'm not around."
"Stinky Pete: Good going, Woody! I thought they'd never leave."
[Then they heard Woody's TV self singing You've Got A Friend in Me much to their surprise]
TV Woody: You've got a friend in me~
You've got a friend in me~
[Woody walk sadly to the TV]
Stinky Pete: Woody?
TV Woody: You've got troubles~
"Well, I've got 'em too~"
There isn't anything I wouldn't do for you~
"[In the vent, Buzz heard the song]"
We stick together and see it through 'cause~
You got a friend in me~
Some other folks might be a little bit smarter than I am~
[Then a kid appeared on the TV. Woody watches as the kid hugs his TV self]
Bigger and stronger too~
Maybe.
But none of them will ever love you~
The way I do
"It's me and you, boy~"
[Woody pick up his boot and scrape the new paint off it to reveal Andy's name on the bottom]
And as the years go by~
Our friendship will never die~
You're gonna see it's our destiny~
Woody Decides To Leave
"Woody: [Woody sighs and realizes that Buzz and The Gang were right all along] What am I doing? [Then like a bolt, Woody stand up from the tape and ran towards the vent] BUZZ! Wait! Wait!"
Stinky Pete: Woody. Where're you going?
"Woody: You're right, Prospector. I can't stop Andy from growing up. But I wouldn't miss it, for the world."
Stinky Pete: No!
Woody: [Woody opens the grill] BUZZ!
Buzz Lightyear: Yes?
Utility Belt Buzz: Yes?
Woody: l'm coming with you! (Suddenly he gets a idea) Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. I'II be back in just a second.
"Buzz Lightyear: Way to go, cowboy! [The other toys cheer]"
"Woody: Hey, you, guys. Come with me."
Jessie: What?
Woody: Andy will play with all of us. l know it!
"Jessie: Woody, l-l. l don't know."
"Woody: Wouldn't you give anything? Just to have one more day with Emily? Come on, Jessie. This is what it's all about. To make a child happy. And you know it. Bullseye? Are you with me? [He happily lick his face] Okay. Good boy. Alright! Prospector. How 'bout you? [But as he turn the box around, it was empty]"
"[Then they heard a clang and they turn to see Stinky Pete screwing the vent shift with his pickaxe much to the shock, Woody, Bullseye and Jessie]"
Jessie: Prospector?!
Woody: Your out of your box!
"Stinky Pete: I tried reasoning with you, Woody. But you keep forcing me to take extreme measures. [He walks over to the remote and uses his pickaxe to turn the TV off. Woody then realizes something]"
Woody: Wait a minute. You turned on the TV last night! Not Jessie!
Stinky Pete: Look. We have an eternity to spend together. In the museum. Let's not start off by pointing fingers. Shall we?
Woody: You really are Stinky Pete. Aren't you?
"Jessie: Prospector, this isn't fair!"
"Stinky Pete: ""Fair""?! I'll tell you what's not fair! Spending a lifetime. On a cowboy doll! Watching every other toy be sold. Well, finally, my waiting has paid off! And no hand-me-down dime-store shelf. IS GONNA MESS IT UP FOR ME NOW! [He lift his box and toss it to the black foam insulation]"
Woody: BUZZ! HELP! BUZZ! GUYS!
Stinky Pete: It's too late. Woody. That silly Buzz Lightweight can't help you.
"Woody: His name is, Buzz Lightyear!"
Stinky Pete: Whatever. I've always hated those upstart space toys.
Woody: It's stuck. What do we do?
"Rex: Can I use my head? [Then, they heard a rumble coming towards the door]"
Woody: It's Al.
"[Jessie and Bullseye gasp and run to their black foam places, Buzz and the Gang went into their cages and Woody flops down to the floor just as Al enters the room]"
"Al: Look at the time. I'm gonna be late. Oh, figures. I can't miss this flight. I've gotta pack. All right. Let's see. Uh, wallet, keys, tickets. Uh. Passport, beef jerky. Very expensive over there. Shower? (sniffs his armpit) Oh, I can skip the shower. I just gotta get outta here now. [He pack up his collection and the hostages (though he doesn't realize that two of them escaped), put them on a trolley and went out of his apartment]"
Buzz And The Gang Vs Zurg
Buzz Lightyear: Quick. To the elevator.
[The toys run to the elevator while Al press the button for it]
Buzz Lightyear: Hurry. I can hear it coming.
"[But then as they reached the top, they gasp for appearing on the elevator was...]"
"Emperor Zurg: So. We meet again, Buzz Lightyear. FOR THE LAST TIME. (Rex screams)"
Utility Belt Buzz and Rex: It's Zurg! [Zurg pull out his ion blaster]
"Rex: Look out, he's got an ion blaster!"
[Zurg fires balls at the group. Utility Belt Buzz leaps over him and fire back with his laser. Al went inside the elevator and it goes down while the battle between Buzz and Zurg continues]
"Buzz Lightyear: Quick. Get on. [Buzz, Slinky, Hamm, And Potato Head slides down the cables. Rex whimpers nervously as he look down to the roof of the lift] The emergency hatch. Come on."
"Rex: (whimpers) Waaaaah! [He slide down the cable very fast and land right onto Potato Head, making his parts go off everywhere. Zurg keeps firing balls at Buzz. Seeing some discs nearby, he grab them and throws them one by one at Zurg. Then as he pick up another few and about to throw them, he saw that Zurg is gone]"
"Utility Belt Buzz: Huh? [Then Zurg appears from nowhere, grabbing Utility Belt Buzz by his hand and lifts him up]"
Buzz Lightyear: Come on. Hurry.
"Rex: But, Buzz's in peril. [Zurg pushes Buzz to a box many times, pressing his button and activating his voice box]"
Utility Belt Buzz's Voice Box: Buzz! Buzz! Buzz! Lightyear to the rescue!
[Buzz opens the emergency hatch and looks down to see Al's green case on a box on a trolley. Zurg spins Buzz on his finger before tossing him to the ground]
"Emperor Zurg: Surrender, Buzz Lightyear. I have won.
Utility Belt Buzz: I'll never give in. You killed my father.
Emperor Zurg: No, Buzz. I AM your father.
Utility Belt Buzz: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"
Zurg Defeated
[Al is waiting impatiently inside the elevator for it to reach the bottom of the apartment]
Al: (Sighs) Come on. Come on. Come on.
"[He didn't notice Slinky dangling above his green case behind him, his back end being held by Buzz, the other toys. Rex runs over to Buzz as Zurg adjusts his ion blaster to the highest level, paying no attention to Rex]"
Rex: Aaah! Buzz. You could have defeated Zurg all along. [Buzz gives up] You just need to believe in yourself. Ah.
Emperor Zurg: [Zurg aim it at him at Utility Belt Buzz] Prepare to die.
"Rex: Aaah! I can't look. [As Rex turns away, his tail hits Zurg and he falls off the roof of the elevator and down to the bottom below]"
Emperor Zurg: Wh-Wh-Wh-Whoa! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
Rex: [realizes that he was the one who knocked Zurg off the elevator] I did it. I finally defeated ZURG!!
Utility Belt Buzz: (sadly) Father...
"[Slinky flip up the locks, opening the green case and Woody reach out and grab his paws. Then the bell dings, indicating that the lift reaches the bottom of the apartment]"
Al: Finally.
"[As Al moves out of the elevator, Slinky tugged to pull Woody out of the case when Stinky Pete appears and grabbed Woody, making Slinky loses his grip on Woody and sprung back. Stinky Pete dragged Woody into the case as it shuts with Al not noticing this. Slinky, and the other toys drop down to the floor. Mr. Potato Head stands up and throw his hat like a Frisbee to stop the door from closing. They ran through the door but as they got to the edge of the porch, Al drives off to the airport]"
Pizza Planet Truck Chase
Rex: How are we gonna get him now?
Mr. Potato Head: Pizza? Anyone?
[A Pizza Planet truck is nearby. Hamm laughs.]
Buzz: Lightyear Go. Go. Go.
Utility Belt Buzz: I got it.
[They bump into each other]
"Buzz Lightyear: Buzz, are you coming?"
"Utility Belt Buzz: No, I... I have a lot of catching up to do with my dad."
[He throws a ball at Zurg who turns out to have survived the fall]
"Emperor Zurg: Good throw, son! That's my boy. Go long, Buzzy!"
[He fires another ball for Utility Belt Buzz to catch]
"Utility Belt Buzz: Oh, you're a great dad. Yippee!"
Buzz Lightyear: Farewell.
Rex: Does anyone know how to drive?
Buzz Lightyear: Slink. Take the pedals. Rex. You navigate. Hamm and Potato. Operate the levers and knobs.
[As Rex hop to the windscreen. He looks up to see three toy aliens hanging from the front mirror by a string which look like the ones from Pizza Planet]
Aliens: Ooooooooooooh.
Alien #1: Strangers.
Alien #2: From the outside.
"Buzz Lightyear: Oh, no."
Rex: He's at a red light. We can catch him.
"Buzz Lightyear: Maximum power, Slink."
[Slinky push the pedal and the truck roared but it didn't move. Rex saw that the traffic light has turn green and Al's car drive off]
Rex: Agh. It turned green. Hurry.
Buzz Lightyear: Why won't it go?
Aliens: Use the Wand of Power.
"[Mr. Potato Head pulls the lever and the truck speeds off after Al's car. Rex yells as the truck zoom through some cones which results in the storage compartment door opening and stuff fell out of it and lands on Hamm, hitting him on the head]"
Hamm: Ooh. Ow. Oh.
Buzz Lightyear: Rex. Which way?
Rex: Left. No. No. I mean right. That's right. No. I mean left. Left is right. Buzz. He's turning left. He's turning left.
[Buzz hops on the steering wheel and turns it to get the truck to turn left. The string which holds the aliens then unties and they start to fall out of the window]
"Aliens: Oh, oh, boy."
[Mr. Potato Head leaps up to the window and grab the string and hold on]
Aliens: Whoa-oa-oa-oa.
[Hamm is reading a manual that have fallen out of the storage compartment]
"Hamm: Oh, I seriously doubt he's gettin' this kind of mileage."
Rex: Go right. To the right. Right. Right. Right. Right.
"[The truck turns right, helping Mr. Potato Head pull the aliens back inside it]"
Aliens: You have saved our lives. We are eternally grateful. (brings the ear back to Mr. Potato Head)
Mr. Potato Head: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Whatever.
[The truck continues chasing Al's car till they reach Tri-Country International Airport]
Buzz And The Gang Rescue Woody from Airport
PA: The white zone is for immediate loading and unloading... No parking.
[The truck parks on the white zone]
Rex: Guys. We can't park here. It's a white zone.
Aliens: You have saved our lives. We are eternally grateful.
PA: Final boarding call.
Buzz Lightyear: There he is.
[They spot Al]
PA: For Far East Airlines flight to Tokyo. All confirmed passengers with boarding passes must board at this time.
[Buzz saw some pet carriers inside the airport which they give him an idea]
"PA: Passenger Twitch, passenger Leon Twitch, please pick up..."
"[A second later, the pet carrier is moving with Buzz's feet walking into the airport]"
Aliens: YOU HAVE SAVED OUR LIVES. WE ARE ETERNALLY GRATEFUL.
Mr Potato Head: Will you just leave me alone?
Rex: Oh. Someone's coming.
[Buzz stops walking and drops the pet carrier as Hannah approaches it]
Hannah: Ooh. A puppy.
"Slinky: Uh, bark-bark-bark-bark. Bark, bark-bark-bark-bark-bark."
[Hannah screams and runs away. Buzz gives Slinky a thumbs up for preventing the girl from discovering them. Al is talking to a staff member and didn't notice the pet carrier walking past him and onto the conveyor belt]
"Staff member: Um, here's the checkers, Al."
"Al: Listen, fly boy, the contents of that case... are worth more than you make in a year. You got that, sport?"
"Staff member: I understand, sir."
"Al: You be careful. Do you have a ""fragile"" sticker or something you can put on that? 'Cause I know what goes on back there."
"Staff member: Don't worry, sir."
Al: I had a box of cookies once that came back as crumbs.
[The staff member put the green case onto the conveyor belt a few baggage from the pet carrier]
Alien #3: The Mystic Portal.
Aliens: Ooooooooooooh...
Buzz Lightyear: Once we go through. We just need to find that case.
"[But as they went inside the baggage sorting area, they saw lots and lots of cases as far as the eye can see. Mr Potato Head gasps, stunned by the sight of all the baggage, making his angry eyes and spare shoes fell out of his back storage compartment. They slide down a ramp to a conveyor belt and land in a heap]"
Slinky: Blech. Ow. There's the case. [The green case appears far away from them]
Hamm: No. There's the case. [Another green case appears below them]
Buzz Lightyear: You take that one down. And we'll take this one.
"[While the other toys went after the other green case, Buzz, go after the green case. They hop over a case but Slinky's back end gets caught on the handle and the case went onto another conveyor belt]"
Slinky: Whoa-oaaa. Buzz. Buzz. My back end's goin' to Baton Rouge. Aaaaaah! [He gets dragged away]
Buzz Lightyear: SLINKY!
[The other toys are almost caught up with the green case]
Hamm: Here we come. Woody. Woody. Here we come. Here we come. Woody. [They open it to saw cameras inside it and not Woody]
Toys: (groans)
"Hamm: Hey. Nice flash, though."
Woody Vs Stinky Pete
[The scene changes to Buzz as they run towards Al's case. He managed to catch up with it and open it]
"Buzz Lightyear: Okay, Woody. Let's go."
"[Then Stinky Pete pops up and punches him, making him stagger back and fall off the conveyor belt]"
Stinky Pete: Take that. Space toy.
Woody: HEY! NO ONE DOES THAT TO MY FRIEND!
"[Woody pounces on Stinky Pete, pushing him out of the case and the two of them wrestle and roll across the conveyor belt til Stinky Pete kicks him off him. Woody lands on the belt. Stinky Pete walks over to Woody and uses his pickaxe to rip his arm, the same one the cleaner fixed earlier]"
"Stinky Pete: Your choice, Woody. You can go to Japan together, or in pieces. If he fixed ya once, he can fix ya again! NOW, GET IN THE BOX!"
Woody: NEVER!
Stinky Pete: FINE!
"[He raises his pickaxe to tear them apart when a white light flashes in his eyes. It reveals to be Buzz, and the toys using the cameras to blind him and run towards him]"
Stinky Pete: No.
"[Buzz grabs him by the back and hoist him up, making him drop his pickaxe]"
Buzz Lightyear: GOTCHA!
"Stinky Pete: IDIOTS!  CHILDREN DESTROY TOYS! YOU'LL ALL BE RUINED, FORGOTTEN! SPENDING ETERNITY ROTTING IN SOME LANDFILL!"
"Woody: Well, Stinky Pete. I think it's time you learned the true meaning of playtime. [he smiles and points to off screen something] Right over there, guys!"
Stinky Pete: No! NO! NOOOOOO!!
"[Seconds later, the Stinky Pete is in a girl's backpack, sliding down a ramp to a rotator where a little girl is waiting to pick it up]"
"Girl: (gasps) Look, Barbie. A big ugly man doll. Ooh, he needs a makeover."
"[As a girl put on her backpack, Stinky Pete unfreezes and deep breathes anxiously. The Barbie doll next to him speaks]"
"Barbie: Hi. You'll like Amy. [She turn her head to reveal stickers on her cheek, much to the Prospector's horror] She's an artist."
Stinky Pete: (sobs with despair)
"Mother: Come on, hon."
[A girl walks off to her mom with Stinky Pete on her backpack]
Woody and Utility Belt Buzz rescue Jessie
Woody: Happy trails. Prospector.
Slinky: Buzz. Woody.
Hamm: Help us out here.
[They're holding the case lid up to let Bullseye get out of it and wait for Jessie to get out]
Rex: Hurry.
"Woody: Oh, no. Jessie. Come on."
Jessie: Oh. Woody. Help. [Then the case reached the ramp outside the sorting area and it slides down to the bottom to a platform where a man picks it up and put it on a dolly a vehicle that pulls trailers of luggage to the aeroplanes]
"Woody: Jessie. [He whistles for Bullseye and climb onto him] Come on, Buzz. Hyah. [Utility Belt Buzz and climb up behind Woody on Bullseye] Run like the wind, Bullseye. [Bullseye slide down the ramp, hop off the platform and chase it] Hey, howdy, hey. Giddy-up."
"Utility Belt Buzz: Come on, Bullseye. Hyah."
[They're getting closer to one of the trailers in front of them]
"Woody: Buzz, give me a boost! [Woody climb up onto Utility Belt Buzz's head and reaches for a tag on one of the luggage but just as he grab it, the dolly rolls in a different direction away from Utility Belt Buzz and Bullseye, leaving Woody hanging on to the tag] Oh! Oh! Oh!"
Buzz Lightyear: Woody!
"[Woody climbs up to the top of the trailer and saw Al's case ahead of him. He runs towards it, jumping from trailer to trailer til he jumps in the one the case is in, unnoticed by the driver. The dolly stops near the plane and the driver puts the case onto a conveyor ramp and onto the plane]"
Driver: Here's the rest.
"Woody: Ah. [Woody watch this, wondering how to get onto the plane when he saw something that gives him an idea. A golf bag is moved up to the plane. A man pick it up and throw it inside. A zip open by itself and the bag opens, revealing Woody and some golf balls as he went out of it. Seeing Al's case ahead, and went to it, unlock and open it to see Jessie curled up in a ball by holding her legs] Excuse me, ma'am. But, I believe you're on the wrong flight."
Jessie: Woody. [She stands up and hugs him]
"Woody: Come on, Jess. It's time to take you home."
"Jessie: But, what if Andy doesn't like me?"
Woody: Nonsense. Andy'll love you! Besides. He's got a little sister.
Jessie: He does? Why didn't you say so? Let's go.
Woody: Whoa!
[They run towards the door and hid behind a bag]
Man: Hold it. There's a couple more bags coming from the terminal.
Woody: Okay. On three. One. Two.
[But the door closes before they can get out]
Man: Too late. Put 'em on the next flight.
"[The plane starts moving towards the runway. Inside the cargo area, the lights went out]"
Woody: This is bad.
Jessie: How are we gonna get outta here?
[A light comes on from the other side of the plane]
Woody: Over there. Come on.
[He and Jessie head over to the emergency hatch and look down at the wheel below them. They turn the handle which opens the hatch]
Jessie: You sure about this?
Woody: No. Let's go.
[He and Jessie climb down to the gears and carefully walks down the axle to the wheel.]
Woody and Jessie Escape the Airplane
[But then Woody slips and fall off the axle. Jessie grabs him by his arm and he dangles above the wheel]
"Jessie: Hold on, Woody!"
"[The tear in Woody's shoulder that Prospector had opened earlier began to widen a bit. As Woody tries to stop it, his hat flies off his head. Then a hand appears as Bullseye and Buzz gallop into view, catching Woody's hat]"
Buzz Lightyear: What's a cowboy without his hat?
Woody: Buzz!
[The plane went onto the runway and started to go faster and faster. Woody saw a screw on the axle of the wheel which gives him an idea]
"Woody: Buzz! Buzz, get behind the tyres!"
"[Buzz and Bullseye decreased their running to get behind the tyres, Woody pull out his pull string and swing it to the bolt which it hooked onto it]"
Woody: Jessie! Let go of the plane!
Jessie: What?! Are you crazy?!?
Woody: Just pretend it's the final episode of Woody's Roundup!
Jessie: But it was cancelled!! We never saw if you made it!
"Woody: Well, then? Let's find out together!"
[Jessie let go and they swing between the tyres and landed on Bullseye behind Buzz. They watch as the plane takes off into the sky]
Jessie: We did it! We did it! We did it! Whoo!
Buzz Lightyear: Nice ropin'! Cowboy!
Jessie: That was definitely Woody's finest hour!
Woody: (cheerful laugh)
"Buzz Lightyear: Your hat, partner."
Woody: Hoo-hoo!
[Another plane lands in front of them startling them]
Woody: Let's. Go home.
Welcome Home Andy
[The scene changes to Andy's family van arriving back at the house late at night]
"Andy: Yee-haw! [He ran upstairs to his room, humming the Lone Ranger song as he climb up to the shelf] Hey, Woody! Woody? [He turns and sees Woody and the toys on his bed with Etch saying ""WELCOME HOME, ANDY!"" on his screen. Then he saw Jessie, Bullseye and the aliens with the toys] Oh! Wow! New toys! Cool! Thanks, Mom! It's a bonus belt, Buzz! It's Bazooka Jane! And her jet-propelled horse! Woody! Buzz! That polecat Zurg has stolen my space cows!"
[The camera zooms to a airport dolly and it's trailers outside the house and morning has come.]
Ending
[Andy looks at Woody whose arm is now fixed at last]
"Andy's Mom: Andy. Come on, hon. Time to go. Hey, you fixed Woody!"
Andy: Yeah. Glad I decided not to take him to camp. His whole arm might have come off. [He leaves the room and Woody unfreezes and looks at his repaired arm]
"Woody: Well, what do you know?"
"Jessie: Yee-hah! Oh! Bullseye! We're part of a family again! [She lifts her boot to show Andy's name written on it. Bullseye lifts up his hooves to show the letters of Andy's name on them which says Dany, but he quickly switches it to Andy as he smiles]"
"Buzz Lightyear: Uh, m-ma'am, I, uh, um... (clears his throat) Well, I just wanted to say... you're a bright young woman with a beautiful ""yarnful"" of hair. A ""hairful"" of yarn. It's, uh... Whoo... Uh... I must go."
"Jessie: [Jessie grabs him before he can walk off] Well, aren't you the sweetest space toy I ever met? [Then they hear barking. They turned to see Buster barking and tapping his feet at the door and paces whimpering]"
"Slinky: What's that? Bark-bark? Uh, this fella says he needs to go out back for a little private time."
"Jessie: That critter needs help! [She went over to a toy car and yodels as she rolls down the ramp, onto the loop and launch off the jump to the door and turn the knob to open it and Buster sped out of the room. Buzz gapes at this, his wings open by themselves. Hamm is playing the Buzz Lightyear video game as Rex walks over]"
"Hamm: Ooh, ooh, oh... Hey, Rex, I could use a hand over here, buddy."
Rex: I don't need to play... I've lived it!
"Hamm: Woo-hoo! Oh, nuts! (he clicks the remote to the TV and the commercial turns on, showing Al in his chicken suit but with a sad look on commercial)"
Al: Welcome to Al's Toy Barn. We've got the lowest prices in town. Everything for a buck-buck-buck. (sobs over his loss of collectors items and failure of bringing Woody to Japan)
Hamm: Well! (chuckles) I guess crime doesn't pay.
"Woody: Now, Andy did a great job. Huh? Nice and strong!"
Bo Peep: I like it. Makes you look tough. [Mr. Potato Head is kissing Mrs. Potato Head when the aliens arrive]
Aliens: You have saved our lives. We are eternally grateful.
Mr. Potato Head: (groans)
"Mrs. Potato Head: You saved their lives? Oh, my hero! And they're so adorable! Let's adopt them!"
Aliens: Daaadddyyy!
"Mr. Potato Head: Oh, no. [Then Wheezy bounces up to Woody and Bo, squeaking perfectly]"
Woody: Wheezy! You're fixed!
Wheezy: Oh! Yeah. Mr Shark looked in the toy box and found me an extra squeaker.
Woody: And? How do you feel?
Wheezy: Oh. I feel swell. In fact. I think I feel a song comin' on! [Mike comes over and throw his microphone to Wheezy who caught it and began to sing You've Got A Friend In Me in a new deep voice] (in Robert Goulet's voice) You've got a friend in me~
You've got a friend in me~
You just remember what your old pal said~
"Babe, you've got a friend in me~"
"Yeah, you've got a friend in meeee~ [Woody hears Buster barking. He went over to the window and look down to see Andy helping Molly walk over to their mum at the van]"
"Andy's Mom: Come on, honey. Come on over. Oh, you are such a big girl. Andy. You think she's ready to drive the car yet?"
Andy: Yeah. And I can teach her.
Buzz Lightyear: [Buzz come over to Woody] You still worried?
Woody: About Andy? Nah. It'll be fun while it lasts.
"Buzz Lightyear: I'm proud of you, cowboy."
"Woody: Besides. When it all ends, I'll have old Buzz Lightyear. To keep me company. For infinity? And beyond. [Wheezy continues singing on a stage out of blocks and with three Barbie dolls as backup singers]"
Wheezy: You're gonna see it's our destiny~
You got a friend in me~
"Barbie dolls: Yes, you do~"
Wheezy: You've got a friend in me~
Barbie dolls: That's the truth~
Wheezy: You've got a frieeeend in meeeeeeeeeee~ Yeah!
"[The iris closes in on Wheezy, end of Toy Story 2]"
"(The instrumental version of Riders in the Sky's ""Woody's Roundup"" plays in the background and the credits roll as the first scene starts where Woody is watching the puppet version of himself singing while he is about to sit on a roll of duct tape) |-"
Man #1: Speed.
Man #2: Marker.
John Lasseter And action.
"(Woody tries to sit down on the edge of the tape, but he ends up falling into the hole in the middle, leaving him stuck. He makes a surprised grunt before he tries to get out of it but his bottom is still stuck in the middle. He finally stands up only to be stuck in a humorous turtle like position. The crew off-screen begins to laugh before Woody starts cracking up.)"
"Woody: *laughing* Okay. *snorting* A little help here, please?"
(Woody laughs again as he tries to walk in a bent forward position. The scene starts where Utility Belt Buzz and Andy's toys are in the ventilation duct of the penthouse.)
"Rex: What are we gonna do, Buzz?!"
Utility Belt Buzz: Use your head!
"(In seconds, they are using Rex as a battering ram.)"
Rex: But I don't wanna use my head!
Toys: *yelling*
"(They all scream as they approach the grate. The camera cuts to a view outside the vent as the toys slam into the grate. However, instead of making the grate to open, the grate would not budge and a loud thud is heard as they all are seen lying down.)"
Rex: Ow!
(The scene starts in Al's Toy Barn in the Buzz Lightyear aisle.)
Man #1: Speed.
Man #2: Marker.
"John Lasseter: Okay, and pull back."
(The camera zooms out to reveal dozens of other Buzz Lightyears.)
Buzz #1: *burping* Whew! I don't remember eating that.
John Lasseter: Cut.
(Numerous other Buzz's start groaning in disgust.)
Buzz #2: *groaning* I can't believe this.
Buzz #3: That's the fifth time.
Buzz #4: What box was that guy in?
"Buzz #1: Sorry, everyone, I had that bean burrito for lunch. Okay, I'm all right now. Sorry."
(Cut to the scene where Mrs. Potato head is about to put supplies in Mr. Potato Head.)
John Lasseter: And action.
"Mrs. Potato Head: I'm packing you an extra pair of shoes and your angry eyes just in case. And if you get hungry, here's some cheese puffs and a key. I don't know what it's for, but you never know. *places another item into him*"
(Cut to the scene where Woody has just met Bullseye and Jessie who is holding Woody.)
Man #1:Speed.
Man #2: Marker.
John Lasseter: And action.
(Jessie flings Woody away and grabs his string. The string suddenly snaps and Woody is sent flying off screen and crashes into something. Jessie looks down at the string horrified at first before she starts laughing hysterically as the crew joins in and even Woody.)
Jessie: Could- Should we just... Should that be part of the movie now? He lost... He lost his string.
"(Jessie laughs again and bends over, clutches her stomach before she drops the string in her laughter. The scene continues on from where Mrs. Potato head is giving her husband supplies.)"
Mrs. Potato Head: And a golf ball  if you have time for golf. And a plastic steak and a rubber ducky and a yoyo.
(The scene starts just before Andy's toys reach Al's Toy Barn and are exhausted.)
Buzz: Who's behind?
Slinky: Mine.
"(Slinky's back end comes walking up slowly to the others then slump down, exhausted.)"
"John Lasseter: All right, cut. Good take."
"Slinky: What good acting. That was a good take. You're such a cute little bottom. Look at you, look at you, look at you, look at you."
(Slinky's tail wags in delight as he pats it. The scene starts where Wheezy is about to start singing.)
"Wheezy: In fact, I think I feel a song comin' on!"
"(He turns towards Mike and holds out a flipper as Mike tosses his microphone at him, but it misses and hits him on the head. Wheezy groans in pain as a loud feedback is heard. Wheezy looks at Mike.)"
"Wheezy: Mr. Mike, I'm so sorry. Did I hurt your equipment? You gotta aim it right here at my flipper. I'm not a very good catch. Okay, I'm ready for another take."
"John Lasseter: Okay, let's go again."
(Mike this time chucks his microphone at Wheezy hard. The microphone hits Wheezy in the face and there is louder feedback. Mike looks away with a roll of his eyes. Wheezy stumbles before he starts wheezing and coughing hard.)
"Wheezy: *wheezing* Oh no! Oh no, I think I swallowed my squeaker!"
(Wheezy comes towards the camera and releases another violent cough and it is seen that his squeaker is gone. The scene starts again with Mrs. Potato Head as she puts more items inside Mr. Potato Head.)
"Mrs. Potato Head: And an extra bouncy bouncy ball. And some extra teeth Be careful, they chatter."
"(She places the teeth inside Mr. Potato head and as soon as she does, a rattling is heard as Mr. Potato head's eyes widen like saucers before jumping up.)"
Mr. Potato Head: Whoa!
(The scene starts where Buzz Lightyear is about to walk down the Buzz Lightyear aisle.)
Man #2: Marker.
John Lasseter: And action.
"(Buzz walks down the aisle and passes a few Buzz's before one box is revealed to have Woody in it making silly faces he can also be heard faintly blowing a raspberry. The crew starts laughing before Buzz looks confused and turns to see the faces he makes. Buzz closes his eyes, waves his hands and snorts. The scene starts where Buzz and the toys are about to leave the house.)"
"Buzz Lightyear: We'll be back before Andy gets home. *presses his button and his helmet covers him but there is a funny mustache drawn on it which causes the crew to start laughing* What? What are you laughing about? Huh? *laughs sarcastically* Real funny, Woody."
"John Lasseter: All right, we're losing our light. Wipe it off and let's go again."
"(Buzz rolls his eyes before walking off screen. The scene starts where Buzz is looking through Lenny the Binoculars after they see Woody safely starting to bring Wheezy back as the others cheer. Buzz lowers Lenny and two large circles that resemble comically large glasses are around his eyes on his helmet. Again, Buzz doesn't notice but the crew does and starts laughing.)"
Buzz Lightyear: What? What's so funny? (Hamm and Slinky who are seen in the scene with Buzz look up to see the circles and also start laughing. Buzz finally notices the circles and glares.) Woody!
"(Scene starts just after Jessie opens the door to let Buster out. Buzz's wings fling out and there are words on each wing. One the left was ""This space"" and on the right was ""For rent"". Again the crew off screen start laughing.)"
"Buzz Lightyear: Huh? *he turns to either side to see the words and glares and starts walking off screen* Darn it, Woody!"
"Man #1: Okay, let's go again."
(The next scene continued on with Mrs. Potato Head putting items into Mr. Potato Head]
"Mrs. Potato Head: And crayons, in case you get bored, and some blue play doh. (Mrs. Potato Head tries to shove the Play-Doh into him. Mr. Potato head lets out a groaning wheeze as some of his pieces start getting pushed out. He covers his mouth and eyes as the Play-Doh pushes his ears and out and starts to squeeze out of the holes, he looks down as the two ears hit the floor. The next scene starts where Flik and Heimlich from ""A Bug's Life "" are on a branch.)"
"Flik: Isn't this exciting, Heimlich? Our first day of shooting."
"Heimlich: Oh yeah, yeah, it's so exciting!"
"Flik: You know, I can't believe you talked them into making A Bug's Life 2 !"
"Heimlich: Oh, oh yeah, I can hardly believe it also. Oh, but there's a little baby tiny thing I forgot to tell you."
"Flik: What's that, Heimlich?"
"Heimlich: Well you know, it's a ""2"" movie, but it's not A Bug's Life 2."
Flik: What...? I don't understand. What is it then?
John Lasseter: And action!
(Buzz is seen chopping leaves out of his path as he approaches. He hits the branch Flik and Heimlich are on and the two scream as they fall out of sight. The next scene starts where Stinky Pete is about to be revealed that he is outside the box.)
Man #2: Marker.
John Lasseter: And action.
"Woody: Bullseye, are you with me? OK, good boy. Hey, Prospector, how 'bout you?"
"(Woody turns the box around to see Pete is still in the box and is talking with two Barbie dolls, he looks away with an amused smile.)"
"Stinky Pete: And so, you two are absolutely identical? *laughing* You know, I'm sure I could get you a part in Toy Story 3. *turns and notices that he's being filmed* I'm sorry, are we back? *chuckling* All right, girls. Lovely talking with you. Yes. Any time you'd like some tips on acting, I'd be glad to chat with you. All right, off you go then."
(The Barbie dolls walk out. The next scene starts where the three Little Green Men in the Pizza Planet truck.)
Man #1: Speed.
"Man #2: Wait, wait, wait. Let me check focus."
"Alien #1: So, did you make it into the first Toy Story?"
"Alien #2: Well, if you look in the letterbox copy, you can see my arm grabbing Woody's ankle."
Alien #3: What will you do next?
"Alien #2: Well, I'm up for this villain in a toothpaste commercial."
Alien #3: Really?
"Alien #1: Wow, that's great."
(The camera cuts to the Potato Heads again.)
"Mrs. Potato Head:...and a dime , call me, and Monkey chow."
Mr. Potato Head |Monkey chow!? For what?!
"Mrs. Potato Head: Well, for the monkeys, of course! Come on, monkeys!"
(A bunch of monkey's from Monkeys in a barrel come up and start screeching at Mr. Potato Head as they try to get the monkey chow.)
"Mr. Potato Head: That's it, I draw the line at monkeys. Get my agent on the phone!"
(He backs up as the monkey's continue screeching at him. The scene starts where Pete is asking Woody about if he really wants to go back to Andy.)
Man #2: Marker.
John Lasseter: And action.
"Stinky Pete: It's your choice, Woody, you can go back, or you can stay with us and last forever."
(Pete's box vibrates as he suddenly passes gas and begins chortling as the crew starts laughing.) |-
"Stinky Pete: Good heavens. Was that me? *laughing* Oh, my. *passes gas again* I am so sorry. I guess that's why they call me Stinky Pete. Whoo! *starts to leave the box*"
"John Lasseter: Okay, let's cut."
(The scene cuts to Tour Guide Barbie who is encased in the iris.)
"Barbie: We are so glad you came. Bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, now. Bye, bye-bye. Remember, please discard all candy wrappers and popcorn containers in the nearest trash receptacle. Thank you. Okay, bye-bye, now. Bye-bye, bye. *laughing* Okay. Are they all gone? Uh, is everybody gone? Huh? *squeaking* Good. Oh my gosh, my cheeks are killing me. I can't keep smiling like this anymore. I am exhausted. I think I need a break. A little break? Okay. Whew."
